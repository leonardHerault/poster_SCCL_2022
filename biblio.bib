	abstract = {Gene expression profiling of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) allows the discovery of previously unrecognized molecular entities. Here, we identified a specific subgroup of AML, defined by an expression profile resembling that of AMLs with mutations in the myeloid transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), while lacking such mutations. We found that in these leukemias, the CEBPA gene was silenced, which was associated with frequent promoter hypermethylation. The leukemias phenotypically showed aberrant expression of T-cell genes, of which CD7 was most consistent. We identified 2 mechanisms that may contribute to this phenotype. First, absence of Cebpa led to up-regulation of specific T-cell transcripts (ie, Cd7 and Lck) in hematopoietic stem cells isolated from conditional Cebpa knockout mice. Second, the enhanced expression of TRIB2, which we identify here as a direct target of the T-cell commitment factor NOTCH1, suggested aberrantly activated Notch signaling. Putatively activating NOTCH1 mutations were found in several specimens of the newly identified subgroup, while a large set of control AMLs was mutation negative. A gene expression prediction signature allowed the detection of similar cases of leukemia in independent series of AML.},

	abstract = {Highly proliferative tissues such as the gut, skin, and bone marrow lose millions of cells each day to normal attrition and challenge from different biological adversities. To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

	abstract = {Over the past 25 years, the importance of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging in overall hematopoietic and immune system health span has been appreciated. Much work has been done in model organisms to understand the intrinsic dysregulation that occurs in HSCs during aging, with the goal of identifying modifiable mechanisms that represent the proverbial "fountain of youth." Much more recently, the discovery of somatic mutations that are found to provide a selective advantage to HSCs and accumulate in the hematopoietic system during aging, termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH), inspires revisiting many of these previously defined drivers of HSC aging in the context of these somatic mutations. To truly understand these processes and develop a holistic picture of HSC aging, ongoing and future studies must include investigation of the critical changes that occur in the HSC niche or bone marrow microenvironment with aging, as increasing evidence supports that these HSC-extrinsic alterations provide necessary inflammation, signaling pathway activation or repression, and other selective pressures to favor HSC aging-associated phenotypes and CH. Here, we provide our perspectives based on the past 8 years of our own laboratory's investigations into these mechanisms and chart a path for integrative studies that, in our opinion, will provide an ideal opportunity to discover HSC and hematopoietic health span-extending interventions. This path includes examining when and how aging-associated HSC-intrinsic and HSC-extrinsic changes accumulate over time in different individuals and developing new models to track and test relevant HSC-extrinsic changes, complementary to innovative HSC lineage tracing systems that have recently been developed.},

Using single-cell transplantation assays with five blood-lineage analysis, we previously identified myeloid-restricted repopulating progenitors (MyRPs) within the phenotypic HSC compartment in young mice. Here, we determined the age-related functional changes to the HSC compartment using over 400 single-cell transplantation assays. Notably, MyRP frequency increased dramatically with age, while multipotent HSCs expanded modestly within the bone marrow. We also identified a subset of functional cells that were myeloid restricted in primary recipients but displayed multipotent (five blood-lineage) output in secondary recipients. We have termed this cell type latent-HSCs, which appear exclusive to the aged HSC compartment. These results question the traditional dogma of HSC aging and our current approaches to assay and define HSCs.},

PLZF displays an epigenetic specificity by recruiting chromatin-modifying factors but little is known about its role in remodeling chromatin of cells committed toward a given specific hematopoietic lineage. In murine myeloid progenitors, we decipher a new role for PLZF in restraining active genes and enhancers by targeting acetylated lysine 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27ac). Functional analyses reveal that active enhancers bound by PLZF are involved in biological processes related to metabolism and associated with hematopoietic aging. Comparing the epigenome of young and old myeloid progenitors, we reveal that H3K27ac variation at active enhancers is a hallmark of hematopoietic aging. Taken together, these data suggest that PLZF, associated with active enhancers, appears to restrain their activity as an epigenetic gatekeeper of hematopoietic aging.},

	abstract = {While the transcription factor NEUROD2 has recently been associated with epilepsy, its precise role during nervous system development remains unclear. Using a multi-scale approach, we set out to understand how Neurod2 deletion affects the development of the cerebral cortex in mice. In Neurod2 KO embryos, cortical projection neurons over-migrated, thereby altering the final size and position of layers. In juvenile and adults, spine density and turnover were dysregulated in apical but not basal compartments in layer 5 neurons. Patch-clamp recordings in layer 5 neurons of juvenile mice revealed increased intrinsic excitability. Bulk RNA sequencing showed dysregulated expression of many genes associated with neuronal excitability and synaptic function, whose human orthologs were strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). At the behavior level, Neurod2 KO mice displayed social interaction deficits, stereotypies, hyperactivity, and occasionally spontaneous seizures. Mice heterozygous for Neurod2 had similar defects, indicating that Neurod2 is haploinsufficient. Finally, specific deletion of Neurod2 in forebrain excitatory neurons recapitulated cellular and behavioral phenotypes found in constitutive KO mice, revealing the region-specific contribution of dysfunctional Neurod2 in symptoms. Informed by these neurobehavioral features in mouse mutants, we identified eleven patients from eight families with a neurodevelopmental disorder including intellectual disability and ASD associated with NEUROD2 pathogenic mutations. Our findings demonstrate crucial roles for Neurod2 in neocortical development, whose alterations can cause neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability and ASD.},

	abstract = {We previously analyzed 15 000 transcriptomes of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from young and aged mice and characterized the early differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) according to age, thanks to cell clustering and pseudotime analysis (Herault et al, 2021). In this study, we propose an original strategy to build a Boolean gene network explaining HSC priming and homeostasis based on our previous single cell data analysis and the actual knowledge of these biological processes (graphical abstract). We first made an exhaustive analysis of the transcriptional network on selected HSPC states in the differentiation trajectory of HSCs by identifying regulons, modules formed by a transcription factor (TFs) and its targets, from the scRNA-seq data., From this global view of transcriptional regulation in early hematopoiesis, we chose to focus on 15 components, 13 selected TFs (Tal1, Fli1, Gata2, Gata1, Zfpm1, Egr1, Junb, Ikzf1, Myc, Cebpa, Bclaf1, Klf1, Spi1) and two complexes regulating the ability of HSC to cycle (CDK4/6 - Cyclines D and CIP/KIP). We then defined the relations in the differentiation dynamics we want to model ((non) reachability, attractors) between the HSPC states that are partial observations of binarized activity levels of the 15 components. Besides, we defined an influence graph of possibly involved TF interactions in the dynamic using regulon analysis on our single cell data and interactions from the literature. Next, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and considering these inputs, we obtained a Boolean model as a final solution of a Boolean satisfiability problem. Finally, we perturbed the model according to aging differences underlined from our regulon analysis. This led us to propose new regulatory mechanisms at the origin of the differentiation bias of aged HSCs, explaining the decrease in the transcriptional priming of HSCs toward all mature cell types except megakaryocytes.},

Scanorama is sensitive to subtle temporal changes within the same cell lineage, successfully integrating functionally similar cells across time series data of CD14+ monocytes at different stages of differentiation into macrophages.

We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space.

	abstract = {Human hematopoiesis is a dynamic process that starts in utero 18–21 days post-conception. Understanding the site- and stage-specific variation in hematopoiesis is important if we are to understand the origin of hematological disorders, many of which occur at specific points in the human lifespan. To unravel how the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment changes during human ontogeny and the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, we compare 57,489 HSPCs from 5 different tissues spanning 4 developmental stages through the human lifetime. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies significant site- and developmental stage-specific transitions in cellular architecture and gene regulatory networks. Hematopoietic stem cells show progression from cycling to quiescence and increased inflammatory signaling during ontogeny. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for understanding aberrant hematopoiesis through comparison to two cancers that present at distinct time points in postnatal life—juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a childhood cancer, and myelofibrosis, which classically presents in older adults.},

However, currently, it is challenging to infer the joint representations and learn relationships among multiple modalities from complex multimodal single-cell data. Here, we present scMM, a novel deep generative model-based framework for the extraction of interpretable joint representations and crossmodal generation. scMM addresses the complexity of data by leveraging a mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoencoder. The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models, and the proposed approach experimentally discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability. Furthermore, we show that crossmodal generation by scMM leads to more precise prediction and data integration compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches.},

	abstract = {Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) combines unbiased single-cell transcriptome measurements with surface protein quantification comparable to flow cytometry, the gold standard for cell type identification. However, current analysis pipelines cannot address the two primary challenges of CITE-seq data: combining both modalities in a shared latent space that harnesses the power of the paired measurements, and handling the technical artifacts of the protein measurement, which is obscured by non-negligible background noise. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. In totalVI, the mRNA and protein measurements for each cell are generated from a low-dimensional latent random variable unique to that cell, representing its cellular state. totalVI uses deep neural networks to specify conditional distributions. By leveraging advances in stochastic variational inference, it scales easily to millions of cells. Explicit modeling of nuisance factors enables totalVI to produce denoised data in both domains, as well as a batch-corrected latent representation of cells for downstream analysis tasks.},

	abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such ‘multilayer’ features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize ‘traditional’ network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular, we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of (i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, (ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, and (iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers.

In this review, we first introduce recent developments in single-cell multi-omics in general and then focus on the available data integration strategies. The integration approaches are divided into three categories: early, intermediate, and late data integration. For each category, we describe the underlying conceptual principles and main characteristics, as well as provide examples of currently available tools and how they have been applied to analyze single-cell multi-omics data.

	abstract = {Regulatory dependencies in molecular networks are the basis of dynamic behaviors affecting the phenotypical landscape. With the advance of high throughput technologies, the detail of omics data has arrived at the single-cell level. Nevertheless, new strategies are required to reconstruct regulatory networks based on populations of single-cell data. Here, we present a new approach to generate populations of gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Our approach exploits the heterogeneity of single-cell populations to generate pseudo-timepoints. This allows for the first time to uncouple network reconstruction from a direct dependency on time series measurements. The generated time series are then fed to a combined reconstruction algorithm. The latter allows a fast and efficient reconstruction of ensembles of gene regulatory networks. Since this approach does not require knowledge on time-related trajectories, it allows us to model heterogeneous processes such as aging. Applying the approach to the aging-associated NF-κB signaling pathway-based scRNA-seq data of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we were able to reconstruct eight ensembles, and evaluate their dynamic behavior. Moreover, we propose a strategy to evaluate the resulting attractor patterns. Interaction graph-based features and dynamic investigations of our model ensembles provide a new perspective on the heterogeneity and mechanisms related to human HSCs aging.},

We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed eﬃciently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute eﬃciently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn2) and space O(n2) in the worst case, and in time O(n2 log n) and space O(n2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth in the number of identified interactions between biological molecules. These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart (RWR) is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each other in the networks.In this study, we extended the RWR algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein–protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases. We devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous RWR as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks. Overall, our framework is able to leverage the different interaction sources to outperform current approaches. Finally, we applied the algorithm to predict candidate genes for the Wiedemann–Rautenstrauch syndrome, and to explore the network vicinity of the SHORT syndrome.The source code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RWR-MH.

	abstract = {Network embedding approaches are gaining momentum to analyse a large variety of networks. Indeed, these approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in tasks such as community detection, node classification, and link prediction. However, very few network embedding methods have been specifically designed to handle multiplex networks, i.e. networks composed of different layers sharing the same set of nodes but having different types of edges. Moreover, to our knowledge, existing approaches cannot embed multiple nodes from multiplex-heterogeneous networks, i.e. networks composed of several multiplex networks containing both different types of nodes and edges. In this study, we propose MultiVERSE, an extension of the VERSE framework using Random Walks with Restart on Multiplex (RWR-M) and Multiplex-Heterogeneous (RWR-MH) networks. MultiVERSE is a fast and scalable method to learn node embeddings from multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous networks. We evaluate MultiVERSE on several biological and social networks and demonstrate its performance. MultiVERSE indeed outperforms most of the other methods in the tasks of link prediction and network reconstruction for multiplex network embedding, and is also efficient in link prediction for multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding.

As capacity and accuracy of the experimental techniques grew, the emerging algorithm developments revealed increasingly complex facets of the underlying biology, from cell type composition to gene regulation to developmental dynamics. At the same time, rapid growth has forced continuous reevaluation of the underlying statistical models, experimental aims, and sheer volumes of data processing that are handled by these computational tools. Here, I review key computational steps of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, examine assumptions made by different approaches, and highlight successes, remaining ambiguities, and limitations that are important to keep in mind as scRNA-seq becomes a mainstream technique for studying biology.},

	abstract = {Lineage-ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of BCL11B, a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose BCL11B to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to BCL11B. Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed BCL11B allele and association of BCL11B with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell cis-regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic BCL11B expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia.
Significance: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. We identify oncogenic deregulation of BCL11B driven by diverse structural alterations, including de novo superenhancer generation, as the driving feature of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias that transcend current diagnostic boundaries.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659},

Here, we assess the performance of a massively parallel droplet-based method for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells using sequencing (scATAC-seq). We apply scATAC-seq to obtain chromatin profiles of more than 200,000 single cells in human blood and basal cell carcinoma. In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development. We anticipate that scATAC-seq will enable the unbiased discovery of gene regulatory factors across diverse biological systems.},

	abstract = {The human body consists of 37 trillion single cells represented by over 50 organs that are stitched together to make us who we are, yet we still have very little understanding about the basic units of our body: what cell types and states make up our organs both compositionally and spatially. Previous efforts to profile a wide range of human cell types have been attempted by the FANTOM and GTEx consortia. Now, with the advancement in genomic technologies, profiling the human body at single-cell resolution is possible and will generate an unprecedented wealth of data that will accelerate basic and clinical research with tangible applications to future medicine. To date, several major organs have been profiled, but the challenges lie in ways to integrate single-cell genomics data in a meaningful way. In recent years, several consortia have begun to introduce harmonization and equity in data collection and analysis. Herein, we introduce existing and nascent single-cell genomics consortia, and present benefits to necessitate single-cell genomic consortia in a regional environment to achieve the universal human cell reference dataset., Profiling the human body at the single cell resolution will reveal a map to enable researchers to compare cell types that are found in healthy and disease tissues at a much finer resolution. Large international projects such as FANTOM (Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome) and GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) have profiled gene expression in hundreds of human cell types. However, the data were obtained from ‘bulk’ samples. The possibility of sequencing large numbers of single cells at a reasonable cost offers the opportunity to create a much more detailed human cell reference map. Jay Shin, at the RIKEN Institute, Yokohama, Japan, and colleagues review rapidly growing single cell genomics consortia and highlight the advantages of initiating national collaborations to harmonize procedures and to obtain a more accurate representation of regional ethnic diversity.},

The success of batch-effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of low-dimensional embeddings, which are inherently imprecise. Here we present a user-friendly, robust and sensitive k-nearest-neighbor batch-effect test (kBET; https://github.com/theislab/kBET) for quantification of batch effects. We used kBET to assess commonly used batch-regression and normalization approaches, and to quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations. This has important implications for future data-integration efforts, central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.},

	abstract = {Cell atlases often include samples that span locations, labs, and conditions, leading to complex, nested batch effects in data. Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration.
Choosing a data integration method is a challenge due to the difficulty of defining integration success. Here, we benchmark 38 method and preprocessing combinations on 77 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing {\textgreater}1.2 million cells distributed in nine atlas-level integration tasks. Our integration tasks span several common sources of variation such as individuals, species, and experimental labs. We evaluate methods according to scalability, usability, and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation.
Using 14 evaluation metrics, we find that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, BBKNN, Scanorama, and scVI perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks; Seurat v3 performs well on simpler tasks with distinct biological signals; and methods that prioritize batch removal perform best for ATAC-seq data integration. Our freely available reproducible python module can be used to identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods, and improve method development.},

	abstract = {A dysfunctional immune response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is a recurrent theme impacting symptoms and mortality, yet a detailed understanding of pertinent immune cells is not complete. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 284 samples from 196 COVID-19 patients and controls and created a comprehensive immune landscape with 1.46 million cells. The large dataset enabled us to identify that different peripheral immune subtype changes are associated with distinct clinical features, including age, sex, severity, and disease stages of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was found in diverse epithelial and immune cell types, accompanied by dramatic transcriptomic changes within virus-positive cells. Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood, may contribute to the cytokine storms frequently observed in severe patients. Our data provide a rich resource for understanding the pathogenesis of and developing effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.},

Here we present a user-friendly, robust and sensitive k-nearest-neighbor batch-effect test (kBET; https://github.com/theislab/kBET) for quantification of batch effects. We used kBET to assess commonly used batch-regression and normalization approaches, and to quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations.

To enable cost-effective single-cell sequencing for millions of individual cells, we developed ‘single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing’ (scifi). The scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial preindexing of entire transcriptomes inside permeabilized cells with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using microfluidics. Preindexing allows us to load several cells per droplet and computationally demultiplex their individual expression profiles. Thereby, scifi-RNA-seq massively increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq, and provides a straight forward way of multiplexing thousands of samples in a single experiment. Compared with multiround combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easy and efficient workflow. Compared to cell hashing methods, which flag and discard droplets containing more than one cell, scifi-RNA-seq resolves and retains individual transcriptomes from overloaded droplets. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, validated it for primary human T cells, and applied it in a highly multiplexed CRISPR screen with single-cell transcriptome readout of T cell receptor activation.},

	abstract = {1 Summary
The biomedical community is producing increasingly high dimensional datasets, integrated from hundreds of patient samples, which current computational techniques struggle to explore. To uncover biological meaning from these complex datasets, we present an approach called Multiscale PHATE, which learns abstracted biological features from data that can be directly predictive of disease. Built on a continuous coarse graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE creates a tree of data granularities that can be cut at coarse levels for high level summarizations of data, as well as at fine levels for detailed representations on subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to study the immune response to COVID-19 in 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients. Through our analysis of patient samples, we identify CD16hi CD66blo neutrophil and IFNγ+GranzymeB+ Th17 cell responses enriched in patients who die. Further, we show that population groupings Multiscale PHATE discovers can be directly fed into a classifier to predict disease outcome. We also use Multiscale PHATE-derived features to construct two different manifolds of patients, one from abstracted flow cytometry features and another directly on patient clinical features, both associating immune subsets and clinical markers with outcome.},

But current analysis strategies, in particular dimensionality reduction and two-phase clustering, offers only limited scaling and sensitivity to define such manifolds. Here we introduce Metacell-2, a recursive divide and conquer algorithm allowing efficient decomposition of scRNA-seq datasets of any size into small and cohesive groups of cells denoted as metacells. We show the algorithm outperforms current solutions in time, memory and quality. Importantly, Metacell-2 also improves outlier cell detection and rare cell type identification, as we exemplify by analysis of human bone marrow cell atlas and mouse embryonic data. Metacell-2 is implemented over the scanpy framework for easy integration in any analysis pipeline.},

However, in-depth single-cell transcriptomic characterization of complex tissues often requires profiling tens to hundreds of thousands of cells. Such large numbers of cells represent an important hurdle for downstream analyses, interpretation and visualization. Here we develop a network-based coarse-graining framework where highly similar cells are merged into super-cells. We demonstrate that super-cells not only preserve but often improve the results of downstream analyses including visualization, clustering, differential expression, cell type annotation, gene correlation, imputation, RNA velocity and data integration. By capitalizing on the redundancy inherent to scRNA-seq data, super-cells significantly facilitate and accelerate the construction and interpretation of single-cell atlases, as demonstrated by the integration of 1.46 million cells from COVID-19 patients in less than two hours on a standard desktop.},

To unravel how the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment changes during human ontogeny and the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, we compare 57,489 HSPCs from 5 different tissues spanning 4 developmental stages through the human lifetime. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies significant site- and developmental stage-specific transitions in cellular architecture and gene regulatory networks. Hematopoietic stem cells show progression from cycling to quiescence and increased inflammatory signaling during ontogeny. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for understanding aberrant hematopoiesis through comparison to two cancers that present at distinct time points in postnatal life—juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a childhood cancer, and myelofibrosis, which classically presents in older adults.},

Precise characterization of clonal architecture is essential to understand the evolutionary history of tumor development and its association with treatment resistance. Here, using a single-cell DNA sequencing, we report the clonal architecture and mutational histories of 123 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The single-cell data reveals cell-level mutation co-occurrence and enables reconstruction of mutational histories characterized by linear and branching patterns of clonal evolution, with the latter including convergent evolution. Through xenotransplantion, we show leukemia initiating capabilities of individual subclones evolving in parallel. Also, by simultaneous single-cell DNA and cell surface protein analysis, we illustrate both genetic and phenotypic evolution in AML. Lastly, single-cell analysis of longitudinal samples reveals underlying evolutionary process of therapeutic resistance. Together, these data unravel clonal diversity and evolution patterns of AML, and highlight their clinical relevance in the era of precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), arise from the expansion of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that acquire somatic mutations. Bulk molecular profiling has suggested that mutations are acquired in a stepwise fashion: mutant genes with high variant allele frequencies appear early in leukaemogenesis, and mutations with lower variant allele frequencies are thought to be acquired later1–3. Although bulk sequencing can provide information about leukaemia biology and prognosis, it cannot distinguish which mutations occur in the same clone(s), accurately measure clonal complexity, or definitively elucidate the order of mutations. To delineate the clonal framework of myeloid malignancies, we performed single-cell mutational profiling on 146 samples from 123 patients. Here we show that AML is dominated by a small number of clones, which frequently harbour co-occurring mutations in epigenetic regulators. Conversely, mutations in signalling genes often occur more than once in distinct subclones, consistent with increasing clonal diversity. We mapped clonal trajectories for each sample and uncovered combinations of mutations that synergized to promote clonal expansion and dominance. Finally, we combined protein expression with mutational analysis to map somatic genotype and clonal architecture with immunophenotype. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of myeloid transformation and how clonal complexity evolves with disease progression.},

We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell transcriptional data from synthetic and Boolean networks that avoids pitfalls of previously used methods. Furthermore, we collect networks from multiple experimental single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We develop an evaluation framework called BEELINE. We find that the area under the precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate. Based on these results, we present recommendations to end users. BEELINE will aid the development of gene regulatory network inference algorithms.},

We have translated this network into a Boolean model to study possible cell phenotype outcomes under diverse molecular signaling conditions. In the context of insulin resistance, the model was able to reproduce the variations of the senescence level observed in tissues related to T2DM's main morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, by calibrating the pharmacodynamics of mTOR inhibitors, we have been able to reproduce the dose-dependent effect of rapamycin on liver degeneration and lifespan expansion in wild-type and HER2–neu mice. Using the model, we have finally performed an in silico prospective screen of the risk–benefit ratio of rapamycin dosage for healthy lifespan expansion strategies.

	abstract = {Devising computational methods to accurately reconstruct gene regulatory networks given gene expression data is key to systems biology applications. Here we propose a method for reconstructing gene regulatory networks by simultaneous consideration of data sets from different perturbation experiments and corresponding controls. The method imposes three biologically meaningful constraints: (1) expression levels of each gene should be explained by the expression levels of a small number of transcription factor coding genes, (2) networks inferred from different data sets should be similar with respect to the type and number of regulatory interactions and (3) relationships between genes which exhibit similar differential behavior over the considered perturbations should be favored. We demonstrate that these constraints can be transformed in a fused LASSO formulation for the proposed method. The comparative analysis on transcriptomics time-series data from prokaryotic species, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as a eukaryotic species, mouse, demonstrated that the proposed method has the advantages of the most recent approaches for regulatory network inference, while obtaining better performance and assigning higher scores to the true regulatory links. The study indicates that the combination of sparse regression techniques with other biologically meaningful constraints is a promising framework for gene regulatory network reconstructions.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional activation by transcription factors is coupled with histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. However, the relationship between TGF-β1-in-duced gene transcription by Krüppel-like factor (KLF)-4 and histone acetylation remains unknown. In our study, KLF4 overexpression or knockdown, respectively increased or decreased H3 acetylation and p300 occupancy, which is concentrated in the region containing TGF-β1 control elements (TCEs) of the genes by TGF-β1 regulation during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays showed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) formed a complex with KLF4 to inhibit the phosphorylation of the latter in basal conditions. After TGF-β1 signaling activation, PTEN was phosphorylated by p38 MAPK or PI3K/Akt signaling, phosphorylated PTEN lost its ability to dephosphorylate KLF4, and the cofactors interacting with KLF4 switched from PTEN to p300. Then, KLF4-p300 complexes were recruited to KLF4-binding sites of the gene promoter of VSMCs, to acetylate histone H3 and activate transcription. In addition, phosphorylated KLF4 enhanced p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity via the p38 MAPK pathway, which may be responsible for H3 acetylation. Taken together, the results of our study reveal a novel mechanism whereby KLF4 mediates the link between TGF-β1-induced gene transcription activation and H3 acetylation during VSMC differentiation.—He, M., Zheng, B., Zhang, Y., Zhang, X.-H., Wang, C., Yang, Z., Sun, Y., Wu, X.-L., Wen, J.-K.

Although this function is well understood, the molecular mechanisms governing this characteristic are largely unknown. We used a sequenced-based strategy to explore the role of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in HSC biology. We characterized the gene expression differences between HSCs, both quiescent and proliferating, and their differentiated progeny. This analysis revealed a large fraction of sequence tags aligned to intronic sequences, which we showed were derived from unspliced transcripts. A comparison of the biological properties of the observed spliced versus unspliced transcripts in HSCs showed that the unspliced transcripts were enriched in genes involved in DNA binding and RNA processing. In addition, levels of unspliced message decreased in a transcript-specific fashion after HSC activation in vivo. This change in unspliced transcript level coordinated with increases in gene expression of splicing machinery components. Combined, these results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is important in HSC activation in vivo.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}BACKGROUND{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Somatic mutations accumulate in normal tissues as a function of time. The great majority of these mutations have no effect on fitness, so selection does not act upon them. Rarely, a mutation will arise that confers a selective growth advantage to the cell in which it occurs. Such a mutation would allow that cell and its progeny, referred to as a “clone,” to progressively expand over time. This is now appreciated to occur in a number of tissues, particularly in aged individuals. When this happens in a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), “clonal hematopoiesis” may result if the mutated clone contributes to the production of a substantial proportion of mature blood cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation (\textit{DNMT3A}, \textit{TET2}, \textit{ASXL1}) account for the majority of mutation-driven clonal hematopoiesis in humans. These mutations are rare in the young but highly prevalent in the elderly, with between 10 and 20\% of those older than age 70 harboring a clone of appreciable size. These individuals usually have only a single driver gene mutated, in contrast to individuals with frank malignancy, where there might be several such mutations. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a clinical entity defined by the presence of a cancer-associated clonal mutation in at least 4\% of nucleated blood cells of individuals without frank neoplasia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ADVANCES{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Large-scale genetic studies have revealed the prevalence and clinical associations of somatic, clonal mutations in blood cells of individuals without hematologic malignancies. One expected consequence of harboring a cancer-associated mutation in blood is an increased risk of developing an overt hematologic malignancy, as the initiating mutation may progress to cancer if additional cooperating mutations are acquired. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that CHIP is associated with an increased risk of developing blood cancers, confirming that it is a bona fide premalignant state. Individuals with CHIP progress to malignancy at a rate of about 0.5 to 1\% per year. Factors that influence the likelihood of progression to malignancy include the size of the clone, the number of mutations, and the specific gene or genes that are mutated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The process of precancerous clonal expansion likely occurs in all mitotically active tissues, as has recently been shown in studies of human skin and esophagus. Clonal hematopoiesis may also be relevant to phenotypes apart from malignancy. The blood stem cells that harbor the mutations give rise to immune cells such as granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. As these cells reside in nearly all tissues, mutations that alter their function could have a variety of phenotypic consequences. For example, recent studies have suggested that CHIP is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thrombosis. The risk appears to be substantial, as the hazard ratio associated with CHIP is as great as or greater than many commonly assessed risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure. Mouse models that carry some of the common CHIP mutations display enhanced atherosclerosis, consistent with a causal relationship between the mutations and the disease. At a mechanistic level, the mutations may amplify the inflammatory response by the innate immune system, a known contributing factor in the development of atherosclerosis. CHIP may be a general factor underlying age-related inflammation and could potentially influence several diseases of aging.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}OUTLOOK{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Although the past few years have seen an explosion of research on clonal hematopoiesis, many mysteries remain. The exact mechanisms by which CHIP-associated mutations cause clonal expansion remain unknown, as does a role for environmental or heritable factors in this process. Nor is it understood why some people develop rapid clonal expansion and progression to malignancy, whereas others have clones that lay dormant for many years. It is likely that the presence of CHIP influences several other diseases of aging, in addition to cancer and cardiovascular disease, but this has not yet been studied systematically. In addition to addressing questions directed at the basic science underlying clonal hematopoiesis, we need to develop strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse consequences of CHIP, such as lifestyle modifications or drugs that lower the risk of hematologic cancer and heart disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The process of mutation and clonal selection is likely to be universal across all organs and tissues. Understanding the causes and consequences of clonal hematopoiesis may provide a framework to understand this process, and aging, more broadly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a multi-functional polypeptide that plays a critical role in regulating a broad range of cellular functions and physiological processes. Signaling is initiated when TGF-β ligands bind to two types of cell membrane receptors with intrinsic Ser/Thr kinase activity and transmitted by the intracellular Smad proteins, which act as transcription factors to regulate gene expression in the nucleus. Although it is relatively simple and straight-forward, this TGF-β/Smad pathway is regulated by various feedback loops at different levels, including the ligand, the receptor, Smads and transcription, and is thus fine-tuned in terms of signaling robustness, duration, specificity, and plasticity. The precise control gives rise to versatile and context-dependent pathophysiological functions. In this review, we firstly give an overview of TGF-β signaling, and then discuss how each step of TGF-β signaling is finely controlled by distinct modes of feedback mechanisms, involving both protein regulators and miRNAs.},

Within the nervous system, cellular and environmental determinants tightly control the expansion and differentiation of neural stem cells. Importantly, a number of studies have indicated that changes in cell cycle length can influence development and physiopathology of the nervous system, and might have played a role during evolution of the mammalian brain. Specifically, it has been suggested that the length of G1 can directly influence the differentiation of neural precursors. This has prompted the proposal of a model to explain how manipulation of G1 length can be used to expand neural stem cells. If validated in non-neural systems, this model might provide the means to control the proliferation vs. differentiation of somatic stem cells, which will represent a significant advance in the field.},

	abstract = {It is not known whether hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo symmetric or asymmetric cell divisions in the unperturbed bone marrow. Here, we integrate data from HSC fate mapping and cell-cycle-dependent labeling through mathematical inference and thus gain insight into how HSCs coordinate self-renewal with differentiation. We ﬁnd that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where Tie2driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and latestage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes. This stem cell hierarchy precedes lineage differentiation and may limit mutation accumulation in the hematopoietic system.},

To address this, we further developed a high-throughput method that enables simultaneously determination of common ancestor, generation, and differentiation status of a large collection of single cells.

Although each family diversifies to some extent, the overall collection of cell types observed in a population is largely composed of homogeneous families from heterogeneous ancestors. Heterogeneity between families could be explained, in part, by differences in ancestral expression of cellsurface markers that are used for phenotypic HSPC identification: CD48, SCA-1, c-kit and Flt3. These data call for a revision of the fundamental model of haematopoiesis from a single tree to an ensemble of trees from distinct ancestors where common ancestor effect must be considered.

Recently, a significant amount of attention has been focused on the inference or identification of the model structure from gene expression data. We consider the Consistency as well as Best-Fit Extension problems in the context of inferring the networks from data. The latter approach is especially useful in situations when gene expression measurements are noisy and may lead to inconsistent observations. We propose simple efficient algorithms that can be used to answer the Consistency Problem and find one or all consistent Boolean networks relative to the given examples. The same method is extended to learning gene regulatory networks under the Best-Fit Extension paradigm. We also introduce a simple and fast way of finding all Boolean networks having limited error size in the Best-Fit Extension Problem setting. We apply the inference methods to a real gene expression data set and present the results for a selected set of genes.},

	abstract = {Boolean networks (and more general logic models) are useful frameworks to study signal transduction across multiple pathways. Logic models can be learned from a prior knowledge network structure and multiplex phosphoproteomics data. However, most efficient and scalable training methods focus on the comparison of two time-points and assume that the system has reached an early steady state. In this paper, we generalize such a learning procedure to take into account the time series traces of phosphoproteomics data in order to discriminate Boolean networks according to their transient dynamics. To that end, we identify a necessary condition that must be satisfied by the dynamics of a Boolean network to be consistent with a discretized time series trace. Based on this condition, we use Answer Set Programming to compute an over-approximation of the set of Boolean networks which fit best with experimental data and provide the corresponding encodings. Combined with model-checking approaches, we end up with a global learning algorithm. Our approach is able to learn logic models with a true positive rate higher than 78\% in two case studies of mammalian signaling networks; for a larger case study, our method provides optimal answers after 7 minutes of computation. We quantified the gain in our method predictions precision compared to learning approaches based on static data. Finally, as an application, our method proposes erroneous time-points in the time series data with respect to the optimal learned logic models.},

	abstract = {Given the immanent gene expression mapping covering whole genomes during development, health and disease, we seek computational methods to maximize functional inference from such large data sets. Is it possible, in principle, to completely infer a complex regulatory network architecture from input/output patterns of its variables? We investigated this possibility using binary models of genetic networks. Trajectories, or state transition tables of Boolean nets, resemble time series of gene expression. By systematically analyzing the mutual information between input states and output states, one is able to infer the sets of input elements controlling each element or gene in the network. This process is unequivocal and exact for complete state transition tables. We implemented this REVerse Engineering ALgorithm (REVEAL) in a C program, and found the problem to be tractable within the conditions tested so far. For n = 50 (elements) and k = 3 (inputs per element), the analysis of incomplete state transition tables (100 state transition pairs out of a possible 10(15)) reliably produced the original rule and wiring sets. While this study is limited to synchronous Boolean networks, the algorithm is generalizable to include multi-state models, essentially allowing direct application to realistic biological data sets. The ability to adequately solve the inverse problem may enable in-depth analysis of complex dynamic systems in biology and other fields.},

Here, we address this question in Drosophila melanogaster for which a large number of high-throughput regulatory datasets are available. We developed i-cisTarget (where the ‘i’ stands for integrative), for the first time enabling the discovery of different types of enriched ‘regulatory features’ in a set of co-regulated sequences in one analysis, being either TF motifs or ‘in vivo’ chromatin features, or combinations thereof. We have validated our approach on 15 co-expressed gene sets, 21 ChIP data sets, 628 curated gene sets and multiple individual case studies, and show that meaningful regulatory features can be confidently discovered; that bona fide enhancers can be identified, both by in vivo events and by TF motifs; and that combinations of in vivo events and TF motifs further increase the performance of enhancer prediction.},

Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. We have therefore identified and isolated an LT-HSC subset that regulates myeloid versus lymphoid balance under inflammatory challenge and with age.},

We then applied them in conjunction with functional assays to track the dynamic changes of immunophenotypically purified HSCs in irradiated recipients within the first week after transplantation. Based on our transcriptional classifications, most homed HSCs in bone marrow and spleen became multipotent progenitors and, occasionally, some HSCs gave rise to megakaryocytic–erythroid or myeloid precursors. Parallel in vitro and in vivo functional experiments supported the paradigm of robust differentiation without substantial HSC expansion during the first week. Therefore, this study uncovers the previously inaccessible kinetics and fate choices of transplanted HSCs in myeloablated recipients at early stage, with implications for clinical applications of HSCs and other stem cells.},

The understanding of how human bone marrow is affected on a transcriptional level leading to the development of myelosuppression is required for the implementation of personalized treatments in the future. In this study, we treated human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) harvested from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with gemcitabine/carboplatin. Thereafter, scRNA-seq was performed to distinguish transcriptional effects induced by gemcitabine/carboplatin. Gene expression was calculated and evaluated among cells within and between samples compared to untreated cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that the treatments effectively decrease cell proliferation, indicated by the proportion of cells in the G2M-phase dropping from 35\% in untreated cells to 14.3\% in treated cells. Clustering and t-SNE showed that cells within samples and between treated and untreated samples were affected differently. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the treatments influence KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies related to myeloid cell proliferation/differentiation, immune response, cancer, and the cell cycle. The present study shows the feasibility of using scRNA-seq and chemotherapy-treated HSPCs to find genes, pathways, and biological processes affected among and between treated and untreated cells. This indicates the possible gains of using single-cell toxicity studies for personalized medicine.},

However, whether cell division in HSCs precedes differentiation is unclear. To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

In this study, we observe an early and progressive loss of lymphoid-primed MPP cells (LMPP/MPP4) with aging, concomitant with expansion of HSCs. Transcriptome and in vitro functional analyses at the single-cell level reveal a concurrent increase in cycling of aging LMPP/MPP4 with loss of lymphoid priming and differentiation potential. Impaired lymphoid differentiation potential of aged LMPP/MPP4 is not rescued by transplantation into a young bone marrow microenvironment, demonstrating cell-autonomous changes in the MPP compartment with aging. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.},

	abstract = {Haematopoiesis, the process of mature blood and immune cell production, is functionally organized as a hierarchy, with self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells sitting at the very top. Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells. Our study provides evidence for a substantially revised roadmap for unperturbed haematopoiesis, and highlights unique properties of multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells in situ.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state.

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc.

At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice.

We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice.

Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset.

To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

However, single cell transplantation assays revealed that the sustained expression of Bmi1 augmented the multi-lineage repopulating capacity of aged HSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs.

Here, we investigated the role of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (plzf) in HSC fate using the Zbtb16(lu/lu)mouse model, which harbors a natural spontaneous mutation that inactivates plzf. Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs.

Notably, in the absence of p16INK4a, HSC repopulating defects and apoptosis were mitigated, improving the stress tolerance of cells and the survival of animals in successive transplants, a stem-cell-autonomous tissue regeneration model.

The in vivo function of p21 in the context of telomere dysfunction is unknown. Here we show that deletion of p21 prolongs the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. p21 deletion improved hematolymphopoiesis and the maintenance of intestinal epithelia without rescuing telomere function. Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments.

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity.

However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors.

The loss of telomeres induces antiproliferative signals that eventually lead to cellular senescence. The enzyme complex telomerase can maintain telomeres, but its expression is confined to highly proliferative cells such as stem cells and tumor cells. The immense regenerative capacity of the hematopoietic system is provided by a distinct type of adult stem cell: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although blood cells have to be produced continuously throughout life, the HSC pool seems not to be spared by aging processes. Indeed, limited expression of telomerase is not sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in these cells, which is thought ultimately to limit their proliferative capacity. In this review, we discuss the relevance of telomere maintenance for the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and consider potential functions of telomerase in this context.

Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

Telomeres also shorten during replicative aging in vivo in hematopoietic cells, including early hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from humans and mice, despite readily detectable levels of telomerase in these cells. To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

	abstract = {The aging of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells is believed to be central to the pathophysiological conditions arising in aged individuals. While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

Surprisingly, our studies demonstrate that conditional Smoothened (Smo) deletion or over-activation has no significant effects on adult HSC self-renewal and function. Moreover, they indicate a lack of synergism between the Notch and Hh pathways in HSC function, as compound RBPJ- and Smo-deficiency does not affect hematopoiesis. In agreement with this notion, detailed genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that silencing of Hh signaling does not significantly alter the HSC-specific gene expression “signature”.

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

	abstract = {It is long known that stem cell differentiation correlates with a lengthening of the cell cycle, in particular G1. Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

Here, we integrate data from HSC fate mapping and cell-cycle-dependent labeling through mathematical inference and thus gain insight into how HSCs coordinate self-renewal with differentiation. We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes. This stem cell hierarchy precedes lineage differentiation and may limit mutation accumulation in the hematopoietic system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division.

	abstract = {The decline in hematopoietic function seen during aging involves a progressive reduction in the immune response and an increased incidence of myeloid malignancy, and has been linked to aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The molecular mechanisms underlying HSC aging remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that elevated activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 in aged HSCs is causally linked to HSC aging and correlates with a loss of polarity in aged HSCs. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 activity functionally rejuvenates aged HSCs, increases the percentage of polarized cells in an aged HSC population, and restores the level and spatial distribution of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation to a status similar to that seen in young HSCs. Our data therefore suggest a mechanistic role for Cdc42 activity in HSC biology and epigenetic regulation, and identify Cdc42 activity as a pharmacological target for ameliorating stem cell aging.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognised that alterations in cell shape and polarity play important roles in coordinating lymphocyte functions. In the last decade a new aspect of lymphocyte polarity, termed Asymmetric Cell Division (ACD), has attracted much attention. ACD has previously been shown to dictate or influence many aspects of development in model organisms such as the worm and the fly, and to be disrupted in disease. Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and suggest approaches to definitively test the physiological role of ACD in lymphocytes.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

The relative asymmetry between self-renewal and differentiation in balance with apoptosis determines the size and durability of a stem-cell pool. Regulation of the cell cycle is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying determination of cell fate. Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

As a consequence, HSCs may undergo "exhaustion" in serial transplant recipients, for which the cellular and molecular bases are not well understood. Hematopoietic exhaustion appears to be accelerated in the absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) in irradiated hosts. Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

We also assessed the expression of several “stem cell” genes in corresponding populations of highly purified HSCs. Fetal and adult HSCs displayed marked differences in their self-renewal, differentiated cell output, and gene expression properties, with persistence of a fetal phenotype until 3 weeks after birth. Then, 1 week later, the HSCs became functionally indistinguishable from adult HSCs. The same schedule of changes in HSC properties occurred when HSCs from fetal or 3-week-old donors were transplanted into adult recipients.

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice. Collectively, Bmi1 regulates self-renewing HSCs in both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous manners.},

Sustained activation of these protein kinases provides cancer cells with the power to enter the cell cycle continuously by triggering G1-S-phase transitions and dramatically shortening the duration of the G1 phase. It has also become clear, however, that CDK4/6 effectively counter cancer cell-intrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms, senescence and apoptosis, which must be overcome during cell transformation and kept at bay throughout all stages of tumorigenesis. As a central 'node' in cellular signaling networks, cyclin D-dependent kinases sense a plethora of mitogenic signals to orchestrate specific transcriptional programs.

However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus.

Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development. They also suggest an ability of HSCs to express CXCL12 in a fashion that changes with cell cycle progression and is associated with a defective engraftment that can be overcome by in vivo administration of a CXCL12 antagonist.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

We show that mouse HSCs, in contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival.

We found that the amount of protein synthesized per hour in HSCs in vivo was lower than in most other haematopoietic cells, even if we controlled for differences in cell cycle status or forced HSCs to undergo self-renewing divisions. Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.},

Here, we show that LT-HSCs utilize glycolysis instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy demands. We used flow cytometry to identify a unique low mitochondrial activity/glycolysis-dependent subpopulation that houses the majority of hematopoietic progenitors and LT-HSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that Meis1 and Hif-1α are markedly enriched in LT-HSCs and that Meis1 regulates HSC metabolism through transcriptional activation of Hif-1α.

We present evidence for a population of cells which, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to adopt erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage fates. Cells in the Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3− HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression. Based on these observations, we propose a revised road map for adult blood lineage development.},

We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

In acute myeloid leukemias this balance is perturbed, locking cells into an immature, potentially ‘immortal’ state. Enhanced expression of miR-194-5p by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or by exogenous miR-194-5p expression re-sensitizes cells to differentiation and apoptosis by inducing BCLAF1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance was found commonly deregulated in 60 primary acute myeloid leukemia patients and was largely restored by ex vivo SAHA treatment. Our findings link treatment responsiveness to re-instatement of miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance.},

Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs.

We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow.

When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation.

Recent evidence suggests that their biologic activities may be modulated through interaction with multitype zinc finger proteins, such as Friend of GATA-1 (FOG) and U-shaped (Ush). In cell culture, FOG cooperates with the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

	abstract = {Fli-1 is a proto-oncogene which is rearranged in tumors induced by three different retroviruses, Cas-Br-E, F-MuLV, and 10A1. This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1432147100},
	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

Both GATA-1 and GATA-2 are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner, their expression being strictly controlled during the development and differentiation of erythroid cells. Closer examination revealed a cross-regulatory mechanism by which GATA-1 can control the expression of GATA-2 and vice versa, possibly via essential GATA binding sites in their cis-acting elements. In addition, recent studies identified several human inherited hematopoietic disorders that are caused by mutations in cis-acting GATA binding motifs or mutations in GATA-1 itself.},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1.

Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

Several recently published methods combine transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression for target prediction, but few of them provide an efficient software package for the community. Binding and expression target analysis (BETA) is a software package that integrates ChIP-seq of TFs or chromatin regulators with differential gene expression data to infer direct target genes. BETA has three functions: (i) to predict whether the factor has activating or repressive function; (ii) to infer the factor's target genes; and (iii) to identify the motif of the factor and its collaborators, which might modulate the factor's activating or repressive function. Here we describe the implementation and features of BETA to demonstrate its application to several data sets. BETA requires {\textasciitilde}1 GB of RAM, and the procedure takes 20 min to complete.

We profiled the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and histone modifications of young and old murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGFβ signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes, and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior. Ribosomal biogenesis emerged as a particular target of aging, with increased transcription of ribosomal protein and RNA genes, and hypomethylation of rRNA genes. This dataset will serve as a reference for future epigenomic analysis of stem cell aging.},

Disruption of these HSC cell fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia. Transcription factors have emerged as critical regulators in this respect.

JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.},

Here we report an additional role for EGR1 in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein.

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment.

Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments.

	abstract = {Bone marrow (BM) produces all blood and immune cells deriving from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The decrease of immune cell production during aging is one of the features of immunosenescence. The impact of redox dysregulation in BM aging is still poorly understood. Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells.

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

Human multilymphoid progenitors, identified as a distinct population of Thy-1(neg-lo)CD45RA(+) cells in the CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cell compartment, gave rise to all lymphoid cell types, as well as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, which indicated that these myeloid lineages arise in early lymphoid lineage specification.

We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are an essential source and reservoir for normal hematopoiesis, and their function is compromised in many blood disorders. HSC research has benefitted from the recent development of single-cell molecular profiling technologies, where single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in particular has rapidly become an established method to profile HSCs and related hematopoietic populations. The classic definition of HSCs relies on transplantation assays, which have been used to validate HSC function for cell populations defined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry information for single cells, however, is not available for many new high-throughput scRNA-seq methods, thus highlighting an urgent need for the establishment of alternative ways to pinpoint the likely HSCs within large scRNA-seq data sets. To address this, we tested a range of machine learning approaches and developed a tool, hscScore, to score single-cell transcriptomes from murine bone marrow based on their similarity to gene expression profiles of validated HSCs. We evaluated hscScore across scRNA-seq data from different laboratories, which allowed us to establish a robust method that functions across different technologies. To facilitate broad adoption of hscScore by the wider hematopoiesis community, we have made the trained model and example code freely available online. In summary, our method hscScore provides fast identification of mouse bone marrow HSCs from scRNA-seq measurements and represents a broadly useful tool for analysis of single-cell gene expression data.},

	abstract = {All blood cell lineages derive from a common hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). The current model implicates that the first lineage commitment step of adult pluripotent HSCs results in a strict separation into common lymphoid and common myeloid precursors. We present evidence for a population of cells which, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to adopt erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage fates. Cells in the Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3- HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression. Based on these observations, we propose a revised road map for adult blood lineage development.},

Current methods for assigning cell types typically involve the use of unsupervised clustering, the identification of signature genes in each cluster, followed by a manual lookup of these genes in the literature and databases to assign cell types. However, there are several limitations associated with these approaches, such as unwanted sources of variation that influence clustering and a lack of canonical markers for certain cell types. Here, we present ACTINN (Automated Cell Type Identification using Neural Networks), which employs a neural network with three hidden layers, trains on datasets with predefined cell types and predicts cell types for other datasets based on the trained parameters.We trained the neural network on a mouse cell type atlas (Tabula Muris Atlas) and a human immune cell dataset, and used it to predict cell types for mouse leukocytes, human PBMCs and human T cell sub types. The results showed that our neural network is fast and accurate, and should therefore be a useful tool to complement existing scRNA-seq pipelines.The codes and datasets are available at https://figshare.com/articles/ACTINN/8967116.

Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identiﬁes community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular “Louvain algorithm”. The computational eﬃciency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identiﬁes community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature.},

It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection.

Here we describe a single-cell digital gene expression profiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75\% (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques and identified 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5 reads. Moreover, 8-19\% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1(-/-) and Ago2(-/-) (Eif2c2(-/-)) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.},

	abstract = {We present here a method for broadly characterizing single cells at the molecular level beyond the more common morphological and transmitter/receptor classifications. The RNA from defined single cells is amplified by microinjecting primer, nucleotides, and enzyme into acutely dissociated cells from a defined region of rat brain. Further processing yields amplified antisense RNA. A second round of amplification results in greater than 10(6)-fold amplification of the original starting material, which is adequate for analysis--e.g., use as a probe, making of cDNA libraries, etc. We demonstrate this method by constructing expression profiles of single live cells from rat hippocampus. This profiling suggests that cells that appear to be morphologically similar may show marked differences in patterns of expression. In addition, we characterize several mRNAs from a single cell, some of which were previously undescribed, perhaps due to "rarity" when averaged over many cell types. Electrophysiological analysis coupled with molecular biology within the same cell will facilitate a better understanding of how changes at the molecular level are manifested in functional properties. This approach should be applicable to a wide variety of studies, including development, mutant models, aging, and neurodegenerative disease.},

Here, by analysing HSC transcriptomes and HSC function at the single-cell level, we identify increased molecular platelet priming and functional platelet bias as the predominant age-dependent change to HSCs, including a significant increase in a previously unrecognized class of HSCs that exclusively produce platelets. Depletion of HSC platelet programming through loss of the FOG-1 transcription factor is accompanied by increased lymphoid output.

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by their self-renewal potential associated to dormancy. Here we identify the cell surface receptor neogenin-1 as specifically expressed in dormant HSCs. Loss of neogenin-1 initially leads to increased HSC expansion but subsequently to loss of self-renewal and premature exhaustion in vivo. Its ligand netrin-1 induces Egr1 expression and maintains quiescence and function of cultured HSCs in a Neo1 dependent manner. Produced by arteriolar endothelial and periarteriolar stromal cells, conditional netrin-1 deletion in the bone marrow niche reduces HSC numbers, quiescence and self-renewal, while overexpression increases quiescence in vivo. Ageing associated bone marrow remodelling leads to the decline of netrin-1 expression in niches and a compensatory but reversible upregulation of neogenin-1 on HSCs. Our study suggests that niche produced netrin-1 preserves HSC quiescence and self-renewal via neogenin-1 function. Decline of netrin-1 production during ageing leads to the gradual decrease of Neo1 mediated HSC self-renewal.},

Strikingly, supplementation of a sympathomimetic acting selectively on adrenoreceptor β3 to old mice significantly rejuvenated the in vivo function of aged HSCs, suggesting that the preservation or restitution of bone marrow SNS innervation during aging may hold the potential for new HSC rejuvenation strategies.},

	abstract = {Age-related defects in stem cells can limit proper tissue maintenance and hence contribute to a shortened lifespan. Using highly purified hematopoietic stem cells from mice aged 2 to 21 mo, we demonstrate a deficit in function yet an increase in stem cell number with advancing age. Expression analysis of more than 14,000 genes identified 1,500 that were age-induced and 1,600 that were age-repressed. Genes associated with the stress response, inflammation, and protein aggregation dominated the up-regulated expression profile, while the down-regulated profile was marked by genes involved in the preservation of genomic integrity and chromatin remodeling. Many chromosomal regions showed coordinate loss of transcriptional regulation; an overall increase in transcriptional activity with age and inappropriate expression of genes normally regulated by epigenetic mechanisms was also observed. Hematopoietic stem cells from early-aging mice expressing a mutant p53 allele reveal that aging of stem cells can be uncoupled from aging at an organismal level. These studies show that hematopoietic stem cells are not protected from aging. Instead, loss of epigenetic regulation at the chromatin level may drive both functional attenuation of cells, as well as other manifestations of aging, including the increased propensity for neoplastic transformation.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks.

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {Single-cell techniques are advancing rapidly and are yielding unprecedented insight into cellular heterogeneity. Mapping the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying cell states provides attractive opportunities to mechanistically understand this heterogeneity. In this review, we discuss recently emerging methods to map GRNs from single-cell transcriptomics data, tackling the challenge of increased noise levels and data sparsity compared with bulk data, alongside increasing data volumes. Next, we discuss how new techniques for single-cell epigenomics, such as single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation proﬁling, can be used to decipher gene regulatory programmes. We ﬁnally look forward to the application of single-cell multi-omics and perturbation techniques that will likely play important roles for GRN inference in the future.},

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging. In this article, we will review our current understanding of these processes and the potential intersections among them.},

	abstract = {Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial to maintain lifelong production of all blood cells. Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis.},

Emerging single-cell omics methods allow for molecular and spatial profiling of cells, and probing of regulatory states and cell-fate determination, thus providing promising tools for unravelling the heterogeneous process of ageing and making it amenable to intervention. These new strategies are enabled by advances in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic technologies. Combined with methods for proteome and metabolome analysis, single-cell techniques provide multidimensional, integrated data with unprecedented detail and throughput. Here, we provide an overview of the current state, and perspectives on the future, of this emerging field.

We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance.

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility.

	abstract = {Bone marrow transplantation therapy relies on the life-long regenerative capacity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1,2. HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined3-11. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

However, this model is based on the analysis of predefined flow-sorted cell populations. Here we integrated flow cytometric, transcriptomic and functional data at single-cell resolution to quantitatively map early differentiation of human HSCs towards lineage commitment. During homeostasis, individual HSCs gradually acquire lineage biases along multiple directions without passing through discrete hierarchically organized progenitor populations. Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis.

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

Parallel in vitro and in vivo functional experiments supported the paradigm of robust differentiation without substantial HSC expansion during the first week.

To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

	abstract = {Molecular changes underlying stem cell differentiation are of fundamental interest. scRNA-seq on murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their progeny MPP1 separated the cells into 3 main clusters with distinct features: active, quiescent, and an un-characterized cluster. Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias.

	abstract = {Declining immune function with age is associated with reduced lymphoid output of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Currently, there is poor understanding of changes with age in the heterogeneous multipotent progenitor (MPP) cell compartment, which is long lived and responsible for dynamically regulating output of mature hematopoietic cells. In this study, we observe an early and progressive loss of lymphoid-primed MPP cells (LMPP/MPP4) with aging, concomitant with expansion of HSCs. Transcriptome and in vitro functional analyses at the single-cell level reveal a concurrent increase in cycling of aging LMPP/MPP4 with loss of lymphoid priming and differentiation potential. Impaired lymphoid differentiation potential of aged LMPP/MPP4 is not rescued by transplantation into a young bone marrow microenvironment, demonstrating cell-autonomous changes in the MPP compartment with aging. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.},

	abstract = {Haematopoiesis, the process of mature blood and immune cell production, is functionally organized as a hierarchy, with self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells sitting at the very top. Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells. Our study provides evidence for a substantially revised roadmap for unperturbed haematopoiesis, and highlights unique properties of multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells in situ.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

To resolve subtle transcriptome differences indicative of lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias in progenitor populations. Here we used FateID to delineate domains of fate bias and enable the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, thereby revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays.

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state.

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc. Mice maintained on a vitamin A-free diet lose HSCs and show a disrupted re-entry into dormancy after exposure to inflammatory stress stimuli.

Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice.

To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing.

Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.

Here, we attempted to ameliorate the age-related decline in HSC function by modulating Bmi1 expression. The forced expression of Bmi1 did not attenuate myeloid-biased differentiation of aged HSCs. However, single cell transplantation assays revealed that the sustained expression of Bmi1 augmented the multi-lineage repopulating capacity of aged HSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs. Therefore, the manipulation of Bmi1 expression is a potential approach against impairments in HSC function with aging.},

Here, we investigated the role of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (plzf) in HSC fate using the Zbtb16(lu/lu)mouse model, which harbors a natural spontaneous mutation that inactivates plzf. Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs. Our study reveals a new role for plzf in regulating HSC function that is linked to cell cycle regulation, and positions plzf as a key player in controlling HSC homeostasis.},

Telomere shortening in response to mutation of the gene encoding telomerase is associated with impaired organ maintenance and shortened lifespan in humans6 and in mice7,8,9. The in vivo function of p21 in the context of telomere dysfunction is unknown. Here we show that deletion of p21 prolongs the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. p21 deletion improved hematolymphopoiesis and the maintenance of intestinal epithelia without rescuing telomere function. Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation. This study provides experimental evidence that telomere dysfunction induces p21-dependent checkpoints in vivo that can limit longevity at the organismal level.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments. These data show that inactivation of p38 MAPK protects HSCs against loss of self-renewal capacity.

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity. As such, they question self-renewal as a characteristic of homeostatic, nonperturbed HSCs in contrast to self-renewal demonstrated under stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew for life, thereby making them one of the few blood cells that truly age. Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. We conclude that the Wnt signalling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.},

Telomeres also shorten during replicative aging in vivo in hematopoietic cells, including early hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from humans and mice, despite readily detectable levels of telomerase in these cells. To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

Here we found that, after mitochondrial activation with replication, HSCs irreversibly remodel the mitochondrial network and that this network is not repaired after HSC re-entry into quiescence, contrary to hematopoietic progenitors. HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division. Thus, loss of fidelity of mitochondrial morphology and segregation is one type of HSC divisional memory and drives HSC attrition.},

We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes.

To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate.

Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

The relative asymmetry between self-renewal and differentiation in balance with apoptosis determines the size and durability of a stem-cell pool. Regulation of the cell cycle is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying determination of cell fate. Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

Disruption of these HSC cell fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia.

JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.},

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein.

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions.

The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment.

Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

	abstract = {This protocol explains how to perform a fast SCENIC analysis alongside standard best practices steps on single-cell RNA-sequencing data using software containers and Nextflow pipelines. SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {\textless}2 h.},

Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche.

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

	abstract = {The aging hematopoietic system undergoes numerous changes, including reduced production of red blood cells and lymphocytes as well as a relative increase in the production of myeloid cells. Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging. In this article, we will review our current understanding of these processes and the potential intersections among them.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

	abstract = {The activity of adult stem cells is essential to replenish mature cells constantly lost due to normal tissue turnover. By a poorly understood mechanism, stem cells are maintained through self-renewal while concomitantly producing differentiated progeny. Here, we provide genetic evidence for an unexpected function of the c-Myc protein in the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs. Collectively, our data indicate that c-Myc controls the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, presumably by regulating the interaction between HSCs and their niche.},

Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Gata1 is expressed in several hematopoietic lineages and plays essential roles in normal hematopoietic development during embryonic stages. The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product2,3,4,5,6. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Gata1 is expressed in several hematopoietic lineages and plays essential roles in normal hematopoietic development during embryonic stages. The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product2,3,4,5,6. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors are master regulatory switches of differentiation, including the development of specific hematopoietic lineages from stem cells. Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow.

Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC.

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

Here we show that hematopoietic progenitors can be reprogrammed by the instructive action of GATA-1. Enforced expression of GATA-1 in hematopoietic stem cells led to loss of self-renewal activity and the exclusive generation of MegE lineages. Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages.

We show here that the upstream regulatory cis element alone is insufficient to confer physiologic PU.1 expression in mice but requires the cooperation with other, previously unidentified elements. Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation. In this model, PU.1 regulates its expression in B cells and macrophages by differentially associating with cell type-specific transcription factors at one of its cis-regulatory elements to establish differential activity patterns at other elements.},

In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG.

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions.

Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1432147100},
	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGFβ signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes, and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior.

Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell's transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis.},

We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating.

We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the adult blood system, and their dysregulation causes a multitude of diseases. However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined3-11. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

However, this model is based on the analysis of predefined flow-sorted cell populations. Here we integrated flow cytometric, transcriptomic and functional data at single-cell resolution to quantitatively map early differentiation of human HSCs towards lineage commitment. During homeostasis, individual HSCs gradually acquire lineage biases along multiple directions without passing through discrete hierarchically organized progenitor populations. Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis. These data reveal a continuous landscape of human steady-state haematopoiesis downstream of HSCs and provide a basis for the understanding of haematopoietic malignancies.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

	abstract = {Molecular changes underlying stem cell differentiation are of fundamental interest. scRNA-seq on murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their progeny MPP1 separated the cells into 3 main clusters with distinct features: active, quiescent, and an un-characterized cluster. Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

Currently, there is poor understanding of changes with age in the heterogeneous multipotent progenitor (MPP) cell compartment, which is long lived and responsible for dynamically regulating output of mature hematopoietic cells. In this study, we observe an early and progressive loss of lymphoid-primed MPP cells (LMPP/MPP4) with aging, concomitant with expansion of HSCs. Transcriptome and in vitro functional analyses at the single-cell level reveal a concurrent increase in cycling of aging LMPP/MPP4 with loss of lymphoid priming and differentiation potential. Impaired lymphoid differentiation potential of aged LMPP/MPP4 is not rescued by transplantation into a young bone marrow microenvironment, demonstrating cell-autonomous changes in the MPP compartment with aging. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.},

Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. We have therefore identified and isolated an LT-HSC subset that regulates myeloid versus lymphoid balance under inflammatory challenge and with age.},

Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells. Our study provides evidence for a substantially revised roadmap for unperturbed haematopoiesis, and highlights unique properties of multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells in situ.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

Here we used FateID to delineate domains of fate bias and enable the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, thereby revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays.

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc.

	abstract = {We identified seven families associating NEUROD2 pathogenic mutations with ASD and intellectual disability. To get insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms, we analyzed cortical development in Neurod2 KO mice. Cortical projection neurons (CPNs) over-migrated during embryogenesis, inducing abnormal thickness and laminar positioning of cortical layers. At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice. Our findings demonstrate crucial roles for Neurod2 in cortical development and function, whose alterations likely account for ASD and related symptoms in the newly defined NEUROD2 mutation syndrome.},

The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial. This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.},

The efficiency of bone marrow transplantation depends on the function of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), which is markedly influenced by their hypoxic niche.

Here, we show that LT-HSCs utilize glycolysis instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy demands. We used flow cytometry to identify a unique low mitochondrial activity/glycolysis-dependent subpopulation that houses the majority of hematopoietic progenitors and LT-HSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that Meis1 and Hif-1alpha are markedly enriched in LT-HSCs and that Meis1 regulates HSC metabolism through transcriptional activation of Hif-1alpha. These findings reveal an important transcriptional network that regulates HSC metabolism.},

We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

Human multilymphoid progenitors, identified as a distinct population of Thy-1(neg-lo)CD45RA(+) cells in the CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cell compartment, gave rise to all lymphoid cell types, as well as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, which indicated that these myeloid lineages arise in early lymphoid lineage specification.

The current model implicates that the first lineage commitment step of adult pluripotent HSCs results in a strict separation into common lymphoid and common myeloid precursors. We present evidence for a population of cells which, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to adopt erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage fates. Cells in the Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3- HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression.

HSC research has benefitted from the recent development of single-cell molecular profiling technologies, where single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in particular has rapidly become an established method to profile HSCs and related hematopoietic populations. The classic definition of HSCs relies on transplantation assays, which have been used to validate HSC function for cell populations defined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry information for single cells, however, is not available for many new high-throughput scRNA-seq methods, thus highlighting an urgent need for the establishment of alternative ways to pinpoint the likely HSCs within large scRNA-seq data sets. To address this, we tested a range of machine learning approaches and developed a tool, hscScore, to score single-cell transcriptomes from murine bone marrow based on their similarity to gene expression profiles of validated HSCs. We evaluated hscScore across scRNA-seq data from different laboratories, which allowed us to establish a robust method that functions across different technologies. To facilitate broad adoption of hscScore by the wider hematopoiesis community, we have made the trained model and example code freely available online. In summary, our method hscScore provides fast identification of mouse bone marrow HSCs from scRNA-seq measurements and represents a broadly useful tool for analysis of single-cell gene expression data.},

Current methods for assigning cell types typically involve the use of unsupervised clustering, the identification of signature genes in each cluster, followed by a manual lookup of these genes in the literature and databases to assign cell types. However, there are several limitations associated with these approaches, such as unwanted sources of variation that influence clustering and a lack of canonical markers for certain cell types. Here, we present ACTINN (Automated Cell Type Identification using Neural Networks), which employs a neural network with three hidden layers, trains on datasets with predefined cell types and predicts cell types for other datasets based on the trained parameters.We trained the neural network on a mouse cell type atlas (Tabula Muris Atlas) and a human immune cell dataset, and used it to predict cell types for mouse leukocytes, human PBMCs and human T cell sub types. The results showed that our neural network is fast and accurate, and should therefore be a useful tool to complement existing scRNA-seq pipelines.The codes and datasets are available at https://figshare.com/articles/ACTINN/8967116.

Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for modularity-based community detection in large networks. The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identiﬁes community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular “Louvain algorithm”. The computational eﬃciency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identiﬁes community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature.},

Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups.

The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells.

	abstract = {We present here a method for broadly characterizing single cells at the molecular level beyond the more common morphological and transmitter/receptor classifications. The RNA from defined single cells is amplified by microinjecting primer, nucleotides, and enzyme into acutely dissociated cells from a defined region of rat brain. Further processing yields amplified antisense RNA. A second round of amplification results in greater than 10(6)-fold amplification of the original starting material, which is adequate for analysis--e.g., use as a probe, making of cDNA libraries, etc. We demonstrate this method by constructing expression profiles of single live cells from rat hippocampus. This profiling suggests that cells that appear to be morphologically similar may show marked differences in patterns of expression. In addition, we characterize several mRNAs from a single cell, some of which were previously undescribed, perhaps due to "rarity" when averaged over many cell types. Electrophysiological analysis coupled with molecular biology within the same cell will facilitate a better understanding of how changes at the molecular level are manifested in functional properties. This approach should be applicable to a wide variety of studies, including development, mutant models, aging, and neurodegenerative disease.},

A key challenge in the analysis of single-cell multimodal data is to devise appropriate strategies for tying together data across different modalities. The term 'data integration' has been used to describe this task, encompassing a broad collection of approaches ranging from batch correction of individual omics datasets to association of chromatin accessibility and genetic variation with transcription. Although existing integration strategies exploit similar mathematical ideas, they typically have distinct goals and rely on different principles and assumptions. Consequently, new definitions and concepts are needed to contextualize existing methods and to enable development of new methods.},

Here, by analysing HSC transcriptomes and HSC function at the single-cell level, we identify increased molecular platelet priming and functional platelet bias as the predominant age-dependent change to HSCs, including a significant increase in a previously unrecognized class of HSCs that exclusively produce platelets. Depletion of HSC platelet programming through loss of the FOG-1 transcription factor is accompanied by increased lymphoid output.

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by their self-renewal potential associated to dormancy. Here we identify the cell surface receptor neogenin-1 as specifically expressed in dormant HSCs. Loss of neogenin-1 initially leads to increased HSC expansion but subsequently to loss of self-renewal and premature exhaustion in vivo. Its ligand netrin-1 induces Egr1 expression and maintains quiescence and function of cultured HSCs in a Neo1 dependent manner. Produced by arteriolar endothelial and periarteriolar stromal cells, conditional netrin-1 deletion in the bone marrow niche reduces HSC numbers, quiescence and self-renewal, while overexpression increases quiescence in vivo. Ageing associated bone marrow remodelling leads to the decline of netrin-1 expression in niches and a compensatory but reversible upregulation of neogenin-1 on HSCs. Our study suggests that niche produced netrin-1 preserves HSC quiescence and self-renewal via neogenin-1 function. Decline of netrin-1 production during ageing leads to the gradual decrease of Neo1 mediated HSC self-renewal.},

	abstract = {Age-related defects in stem cells can limit proper tissue maintenance and hence contribute to a shortened lifespan. Using highly purified hematopoietic stem cells from mice aged 2 to 21 mo, we demonstrate a deficit in function yet an increase in stem cell number with advancing age. Expression analysis of more than 14,000 genes identified 1,500 that were age-induced and 1,600 that were age-repressed. Genes associated with the stress response, inflammation, and protein aggregation dominated the up-regulated expression profile, while the down-regulated profile was marked by genes involved in the preservation of genomic integrity and chromatin remodeling. Many chromosomal regions showed coordinate loss of transcriptional regulation; an overall increase in transcriptional activity with age and inappropriate expression of genes normally regulated by epigenetic mechanisms was also observed. Hematopoietic stem cells from early-aging mice expressing a mutant p53 allele reveal that aging of stem cells can be uncoupled from aging at an organismal level. These studies show that hematopoietic stem cells are not protected from aging. Instead, loss of epigenetic regulation at the chromatin level may drive both functional attenuation of cells, as well as other manifestations of aging, including the increased propensity for neoplastic transformation.},

To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs.

Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs.

Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments. These data show that inactivation of p38 MAPK protects HSCs against loss of self-renewal capacity.

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity.

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew for life, thereby making them one of the few blood cells that truly age. Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

Identifying the mechanisms underlying age-dependent stem cell dysfunction is therefore key to understanding the aging process. Here, using a model carrying a proofreading-defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase, we demonstrate hematopoietic defects reminiscent of premature HSC aging, including anemia, lymphopenia, and myeloid lineage skewing. However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors. These results show that intact mitochondrial function is required for appropriate multilineage stem cell differentiation, but argue against mitochondrial DNA mutations per se being a primary driver of somatic stem cell aging.},

Telomeres also shorten during replicative aging in vivo in hematopoietic cells, including early hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from humans and mice, despite readily detectable levels of telomerase in these cells. To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

	abstract = {The replicative lifespan of normal somatic cells is restricted by the erosion of telomeres, which are protective caps at the ends of linear chromosomes. The loss of telomeres induces antiproliferative signals that eventually lead to cellular senescence. The enzyme complex telomerase can maintain telomeres, but its expression is confined to highly proliferative cells such as stem cells and tumor cells. The immense regenerative capacity of the hematopoietic system is provided by a distinct type of adult stem cell: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although blood cells have to be produced continuously throughout life, the HSC pool seems not to be spared by aging processes. Indeed, limited expression of telomerase is not sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in these cells, which is thought ultimately to limit their proliferative capacity. In this review, we discuss the relevance of telomere maintenance for the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and consider potential functions of telomerase in this context. We also present possible clinical applications of telomere manipulation in HSCs and new insights affecting the aging of the hematopoietic stem cell pool and replicative exhaustion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

	abstract = {The aging of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells is believed to be central to the pathophysiological conditions arising in aged individuals. While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

	abstract = {The aging hematopoietic system undergoes numerous changes, including reduced production of red blood cells and lymphocytes as well as a relative increase in the production of myeloid cells. Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively.

We show that profiling the genomic perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell enables us to simultaneously elucidate the function of multiple factors and their interactions. We applied CRISP-seq to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors. These include opposing effects of Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to pathogens. This study establishes CRISP-seq as a broadly applicable, comprehensive, and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits.},

Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on {\textgreater}50,000 individual cells across three tissues in young and old mice to allow for direct comparison of aging phenotypes across cell types. We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating. These results suggest that aging manifests with unique directionality and magnitude across the diverse cell identities in mammals.},

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

During homeostasis, individual HSCs gradually acquire lineage biases along multiple directions without passing through discrete hierarchically organized progenitor populations. Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis.

Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

To gain deeper insight into the gene expression program of murine HSCs, we combined single-cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single-cell gene expression assays. Through bioinformatic integration of these datasets, we designed an unbiased sorting strategy that separates non-HSCs away from HSCs, and single-cell transplantation experiments using the enriched population were combined with RNA-seq data to identify key molecules that associate with long-term durable self-renewal, producing a single-cell molecular dataset that is linked to functional stem cell activity. Finally, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this approach for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions in another stem cell system.},

Sub-fractionation of the HSC compartment in RA-CFP reporter mice demonstrated that RA-CFP-dim HSCs were largely non-proliferative and displayed superior engraftment potential in comparison with RA-CFP-bright HSCs. Gene expression analysis demonstrated higher expression of RA-target genes in RA-CFP-dim HSCs, in contrast to the RA-CFP reporter expression, but both RA-CFP-dim and RA-CFP-bright HSCs responded efficiently to RA in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of {\textgreater}1,200 HSCs showed that differences in cell cycle activity constituted the main driver of transcriptional heterogeneity in HSCs. Moreover, further analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that stochastic low-level expression of distinct lineage-affiliated transcriptional programs is a common feature of HSCs.

We then applied them in conjunction with functional assays to track the dynamic changes of immunophenotypically purified HSCs in irradiated recipients within the first week after transplantation. Based on our transcriptional classifications, most homed HSCs in bone marrow and spleen became multipotent progenitors and, occasionally, some HSCs gave rise to megakaryocytic–erythroid or myeloid precursors. Parallel in vitro and in vivo functional experiments supported the paradigm of robust differentiation without substantial HSC expansion during the first week. Therefore, this study uncovers the previously inaccessible kinetics and fate choices of transplanted HSCs in myeloablated recipients at early stage, with implications for clinical applications of HSCs and other stem cells.},

Thereafter, scRNA-seq was performed to distinguish transcriptional effects induced by gemcitabine/carboplatin. Gene expression was calculated and evaluated among cells within and between samples compared to untreated cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that the treatments effectively decrease cell proliferation, indicated by the proportion of cells in the G2M-phase dropping from 35\% in untreated cells to 14.3\% in treated cells.

However, whether cell division in HSCs precedes differentiation is unclear. To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

	abstract = {Molecular changes underlying stem cell differentiation are of fundamental interest. scRNA-seq on murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their progeny MPP1 separated the cells into 3 main clusters with distinct features: active, quiescent, and an un-characterized cluster. Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

In this study, we observe an early and progressive loss of lymphoid-primed MPP cells (LMPP/MPP4) with aging, concomitant with expansion of HSCs. Transcriptome and in vitro functional analyses at the single-cell level reveal a concurrent increase in cycling of aging LMPP/MPP4 with loss of lymphoid priming and differentiation potential. Impaired lymphoid differentiation potential of aged LMPP/MPP4 is not rescued by transplantation into a young bone marrow microenvironment, demonstrating cell-autonomous changes in the MPP compartment with aging. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.},

Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias.

Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells. Our study provides evidence for a substantially revised roadmap for unperturbed haematopoiesis, and highlights unique properties of multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells in situ.},

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc.

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations.

Through bioinformatic integration of these datasets, we designed an unbiased sorting strategy that separates non-HSCs away from HSCs, and single-cell transplantation experiments using the enriched population were combined with RNA-seq data to identify key molecules that associate with long-term durable self-renewal, producing a single-cell molecular dataset that is linked to functional stem cell activity.

To get insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms, we analyzed cortical development in Neurod2 KO mice. Cortical projection neurons (CPNs) over-migrated during embryogenesis, inducing abnormal thickness and laminar positioning of cortical layers. At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice. Our findings demonstrate crucial roles for Neurod2 in cortical development and function, whose alterations likely account for ASD and related symptoms in the newly defined NEUROD2 mutation syndrome.},

To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

	abstract = {Highly proliferative tissues such as the gut, skin, and bone marrow lose millions of cells each day to normal attrition and challenge from different biological adversities. To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain.

Here, we investigated the role of the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (plzf) in HSC fate using the Zbtb16(lu/lu)mouse model, which harbors a natural spontaneous mutation that inactivates plzf. Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs. Our study reveals a new role for plzf in regulating HSC function that is linked to cell cycle regulation, and positions plzf as a key player in controlling HSC homeostasis.},

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments.

Telomere shortening in response to mutation of the gene encoding telomerase is associated with impaired organ maintenance and shortened lifespan in humans6 and in mice7,8,9. The in vivo function of p21 in the context of telomere dysfunction is unknown. Here we show that deletion of p21 prolongs the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. p21 deletion improved hematolymphopoiesis and the maintenance of intestinal epithelia without rescuing telomere function. Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation. This study provides experimental evidence that telomere dysfunction induces p21-dependent checkpoints in vivo that can limit longevity at the organismal level.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity. As such, they question self-renewal as a characteristic of homeostatic, nonperturbed HSCs in contrast to self-renewal demonstrated under stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew for life, thereby making them one of the few blood cells that truly age. Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors.

To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

	abstract = {The replicative lifespan of normal somatic cells is restricted by the erosion of telomeres, which are protective caps at the ends of linear chromosomes. The loss of telomeres induces antiproliferative signals that eventually lead to cellular senescence. The enzyme complex telomerase can maintain telomeres, but its expression is confined to highly proliferative cells such as stem cells and tumor cells. The immense regenerative capacity of the hematopoietic system is provided by a distinct type of adult stem cell: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although blood cells have to be produced continuously throughout life, the HSC pool seems not to be spared by aging processes. Indeed, limited expression of telomerase is not sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in these cells, which is thought ultimately to limit their proliferative capacity. In this review, we discuss the relevance of telomere maintenance for the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and consider potential functions of telomerase in this context.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs.

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

	abstract = {It is long known that stem cell differentiation correlates with a lengthening of the cell cycle, in particular G1. Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

Here we found that, after mitochondrial activation with replication, HSCs irreversibly remodel the mitochondrial network and that this network is not repaired after HSC re-entry into quiescence, contrary to hematopoietic progenitors. HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division.

Here, we integrate data from HSC fate mapping and cell-cycle-dependent labeling through mathematical inference and thus gain insight into how HSCs coordinate self-renewal with differentiation. We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes. This stem cell hierarchy precedes lineage differentiation and may limit mutation accumulation in the hematopoietic system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the last decade a new aspect of lymphocyte polarity, termed Asymmetric Cell Division (ACD), has attracted much attention. ACD has previously been shown to dictate or influence many aspects of development in model organisms such as the worm and the fly, and to be disrupted in disease. Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and suggest approaches to definitively test the physiological role of ACD in lymphocytes.},

Pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 activity functionally rejuvenates aged HSCs, increases the percentage of polarized cells in an aged HSC population, and restores the level and spatial distribution of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation to a status similar to that seen in young HSCs. Our data therefore suggest a mechanistic role for Cdc42 activity in HSC biology and epigenetic regulation, and identify Cdc42 activity as a pharmacological target for ameliorating stem cell aging.},

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.

	abstract = {Research over the past quarter century has identified cyclin D-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, as the major oncogenic drivers among members of the CDK superfamily. CDK4/6 are rendered hyperactive in the majority of human cancers through a multitude of genomic alterations. Sustained activation of these protein kinases provides cancer cells with the power to enter the cell cycle continuously by triggering G1-S-phase transitions and dramatically shortening the duration of the G1 phase. It has also become clear, however, that CDK4/6 effectively counter cancer cell-intrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms, senescence and apoptosis, which must be overcome during cell transformation and kept at bay throughout all stages of tumorigenesis. As a central 'node' in cellular signaling networks, cyclin D-dependent kinases sense a plethora of mitogenic signals to orchestrate specific transcriptional programs. As the complexity of the cellular signaling network regulated by these oncogenic kinases unfolds, much remains to be learned about its architecture, its dynamics and the consequences of its perturbation.},

Cell labeling with division-sensitive markers and competitive transplantation studies have been used to estimate the replication rate of murine HSCs in vivo. However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

Here we show that in mice, all HSCs are cycling until 3 weeks after birth. Then, within 1 week, most became quiescent. Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development. They also suggest an ability of HSCs to express CXCL12 in a fashion that changes with cell cycle progression and is associated with a defective engraftment that can be overcome by in vivo administration of a CXCL12 antagonist.},

Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus. Our results therefore suggest that, among Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitors, p57 plays a predominant role in the quiescence and maintenance of adult HSCs.},

The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment.

We show that the Fli1+12 enhancer, like the Gata2-3 and Scl+19 enhancers, targets hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and relies on a combination of Ets, Gata, and E-Box motifs. We show that the Gata2-3 enhancer also uses a similar cluster of motifs and that Gata2, Fli1, and Scl are expressed in embryonic day-11.5 dorsal aorta where HSCs originate and in fetal liver where they multiply. The three HSC enhancers in these tissues and in ES cell-derived hemangioblast equivalents are bound by each of these transcription factors (TFs) and form a fully connected triad that constitutes a previously undescribed example of both this network motif in mammalian development and a GRN kernel operating during the specification of a mammalian stem cell.},

These epigenetic players are categorized as writers: that introduce various chemical modifications on DNA and histones, readers: the specialized domain containing proteins that identify and interpret those modifications and erasers: the dedicated group of enzymes proficient in removing these chemical tags. Research over the past few decades has established that these epigenetic tools are associated with numerous disease conditions especially cancer. Besides, with the involvement of epigenetics in cancer, these enzymes and protein domains provide new targets for cancer drug development. This is certain from the volume of epigenetic research conducted in universities and R\&D sector of pharmaceutical industry. Here we have highlighted the different types of epigenetic enzymes and protein domains with an emphasis on methylation and acetylation. This review also deals with the recent developments in small molecule inhibitors as potential anti-cancer drugs targeting the epigenetic space.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow.

Interactions of hematopoietic cells with the stroma/microenvironment inside bone cavities are central to hematopoiesis as they regulate cell proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. We recently hypothesized that one underlying cause of altered hematopoiesis in aging might be due to altered interactions of aged stem cells with the microenvironment/niche. We developed time-lapse 2-photon microscopy and novel image analysis algorithms to quantify the dynamics of young and aged hematopoietic cells inside the marrow of long bones of mice in vivo. We report in this study that aged early hematopoietic progenitor cells (eHPCs) present with increased cell protrusion movement in vivo and localize more distantly to the endosteum compared with young eHPCs. This correlated with reduced adhesion to stroma cells as well as reduced cell polarity upon adhesion of aged eHPCs. These data support a role of altered eHPC dynamics and altered cell polarity, and thus altered niche biology in mechanisms of mammalian aging.},

Though the mouse HSC population has been shown to change both quantitatively and functionally with age, changes in the human HSC and progenitor cell populations during aging have been incompletely characterized. To elucidate the properties of an aged human hematopoietic system that may predispose to age-associated hematopoietic dysfunction, we evaluated immunophenotypic HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor populations from healthy, hematologically normal young and elderly human bone marrow samples. We found that aged immunophenotypic human HSC increase in frequency, are less quiescent, and exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation potential compared with young HSC. Gene expression profiling revealed that aged immunophenotypic human HSC transcriptionally up-regulate genes associated with cell cycle, myeloid lineage specification, and myeloid malignancies. These age-associated alterations in the frequency, developmental potential, and gene expression profile of human HSC are similar to those changes observed in mouse HSC, suggesting that hematopoietic aging is an evolutionarily conserved process.},

We observed a variable increase of HSC pool size with age, accompanied by the accumulation of predominantly myeloid-biased HSCs that regenerate substantially fewer mature progeny than young myeloid-biased HSCs and exhibit reduced self-renewal activity as measured by long-term secondary transplantation. Old HSCs had a twofold reduction in marrow-homing efficiency and a similar decrease in functional frequency as measured using long-term transplantation assays. Similarly, old HSCs had a twofold reduced seeding efficiency and a significantly delayed proliferative response compared with young HSCs in long-term stromal cell co-cultures but were indistinguishable in suspension cultures. We show that these functional defects are characteristics of most or all old HSCs and are not indicative of a nonfunctional subset of cells that express HSC markers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cells with functional properties of old HSCs can be generated directly from young HSCs by extended serial transplantation, which is consistent with the possibility that they arise through a process of cellular aging.},

The functional ability per HSC, as well as the HSC concentration, was measured with minimal disruption to the cells in vivo using the new competitive dilution assay. Distribution of HSC into recipients was modeled based on Poisson probabilities. Predictions of donor contributions from models assuming different levels of donor HSC functional ability and concentration were compared to actual observations. The model with the least difference between predictions and observations was accepted. In BALB/ cBy (BALB) mice, models assuming equal functional ability of HSC from the same donor fit extremely well with actual observations, suggesting that all HSC are functionally homogeneous at any particular time point during development or aging. Relative HSC functional ability per cell declined during development, so that a fetal HSC had 1.6 to 3.0 times the functional ability of a young adult HSC. The decline continued with age, so that a young adult HSC had 1.6 to 2.0 times the functional ability of an old HSC. Concentrations of HSC that engrafted and functioned were similar among 16-day fetal liver cells and bone marrow cells (BMC) from 3-month and 25 to 28-month-old adult mice. They were either 10 or 4 HSC per million cells when tested in BALB or CByB6F1 recipients, respectively. All HSC were pluripotent and produced lymphoid and myeloid descendants proportionally (r = 0.80 to 0.98, p {\textless} 0.01). Fetal and young HSC in both types of recipients maintained clonal stability long term so that percentages of donor cells at 6 and 9 months were strongly correlated (r = 0.72 to 0.93, p {\textless} 0.01). Although HSC from aged donors in BALB recipients maintained clonal stability, HSC from the same aged donors failed to show clonal stability in CByB6F1 recipients, perhaps due to the less suitable host environment. All HSC from BALB mice seemed to have equal functional levels at a given stage of life and were gradually exhausted simultaneously through development and aging.},

	abstract = {In this paper we extend the "network theory of aging," and we argue that a global reduction in the capacity to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status are major characteristics of the aging process. This phenomenon, which we will refer to as "inflamm-aging," is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. On the basis of evolutionary studies, we also argue that the immune and the stress responses are equivalent and that antigens are nothing other than particular types of stressors. We also propose to return macrophage to its rightful place as central actor not only in the inflammatory response and immunity, but also in the stress response. The rate of reaching the threshold of proinflammatory status over which diseases/disabilities ensue and the individual capacity to cope with and adapt to stressors are assumed to be complex traits with a genetic component. Finally, we argue that the persistence of inflammatory stimuli over time represents the biologic background (first hit) favoring the susceptibility to age-related diseases/disabilities. A second hit (absence of robust gene variants and/or presence of frail gene variants) is likely necessary to develop overt organ-specific age-related diseases having an inflammatory pathogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Following this perspective, several paradoxes of healthy centenarians (increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and coagulation factors) are illustrated and explained. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.},

Due to the complex and multi-factorial nature of both aging and cancer, accurate deciphering of causative links between aging and cancer remains a major challenge. It is generally accepted that initiation and progression of cancers are driven by a process of clonal evolution. In principle, this somatic evolution should follow the same Darwinian logic as evolutionary processes in populations in nature: diverse heritable types arising as a result of mutations are subjected to selection, resulting in expansion of the fittest clones. However, prevalent paradigms focus primarily on mutational aspects in linking aging and cancer. In this review, we will argue that age-related changes in selective pressures are likely to be equally important. We will focus on aging-related changes in the hematopoietic system, where age-associated alterations are relatively well studied, and discuss the impact of these changes on the development of leukemias and other malignancies.},

Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs.

Moreover, they indicate a lack of synergism between the Notch and Hh pathways in HSC function, as compound RBPJ- and Smo-deficiency does not affect hematopoiesis. In agreement with this notion, detailed genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that silencing of Hh signaling does not significantly alter the HSC-specific gene expression “signature”.

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division.

We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes.

Pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 activity functionally rejuvenates aged HSCs, increases the percentage of polarized cells in an aged HSC population, and restores the level and spatial distribution of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation to a status similar to that seen in young HSCs. Our data therefore suggest a mechanistic role for Cdc42 activity in HSC biology and epigenetic regulation, and identify Cdc42 activity as a pharmacological target for ameliorating stem cell aging.},

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

In the last decade a new aspect of lymphocyte polarity, termed Asymmetric Cell Division (ACD), has attracted much attention. ACD has previously been shown to dictate or influence many aspects of development in model organisms such as the worm and the fly, and to be disrupted in disease. Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and suggest approaches to definitively test the physiological role of ACD in lymphocytes.},

Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

The relative asymmetry between self-renewal and differentiation in balance with apoptosis determines the size and durability of a stem-cell pool. Regulation of the cell cycle is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying determination of cell fate. Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

As a consequence, HSCs may undergo "exhaustion" in serial transplant recipients, for which the cellular and molecular bases are not well understood. Hematopoietic exhaustion appears to be accelerated in the absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) in irradiated hosts. Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

We also assessed the expression of several “stem cell” genes in corresponding populations of highly purified HSCs. Fetal and adult HSCs displayed marked differences in their self-renewal, differentiated cell output, and gene expression properties, with persistence of a fetal phenotype until 3 weeks after birth. Then, 1 week later, the HSCs became functionally indistinguishable from adult HSCs. The same schedule of changes in HSC properties occurred when HSCs from fetal or 3-week-old donors were transplanted into adult recipients.

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.

Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus. Our results therefore suggest that, among Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitors, p57 plays a predominant role in the quiescence and maintenance of adult HSCs.},

However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all lineages of blood cells. Because HSCs must persist for a lifetime, the balance between their proliferation and quiescence is carefully regulated to ensure blood homeostasis while limiting cellular damage. Cell cycle regulation therefore plays a critical role in controlling HSC function during both fetal life and in the adult. The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment. This fine-tuned regulatory network may become altered with age, leading to aberrant HSC cell cycle regulation, degraded HSC function, and hematological malignancy.},

We describe a regulatory circuit made up of Gata2, Fli1, and Scl/Tal1 and their enhancers, Gata2-3, Fli1+12, and Scl+19, that operates during specification of hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo. We show that the Fli1+12 enhancer, like the Gata2-3 and Scl+19 enhancers, targets hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and relies on a combination of Ets, Gata, and E-Box motifs. We show that the Gata2-3 enhancer also uses a similar cluster of motifs and that Gata2, Fli1, and Scl are expressed in embryonic day-11.5 dorsal aorta where HSCs originate and in fetal liver where they multiply. The three HSC enhancers in these tissues and in ES cell-derived hemangioblast equivalents are bound by each of these transcription factors (TFs) and form a fully connected triad that constitutes a previously undescribed example of both this network motif in mammalian development and a GRN kernel operating during the specification of a mammalian stem cell.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

How HSCs accommodate the diverse cellular stresses associated with their life-long activity remains elusive. Here we identify autophagy as an essential mechanism protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. We show that mouse HSCs, in contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival. Our results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system.},

We found that the amount of protein synthesized per hour in HSCs in vivo was lower than in most other haematopoietic cells, even if we controlled for differences in cell cycle status or forced HSCs to undergo self-renewing divisions. Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.},

Here, we show that LT-HSCs utilize glycolysis instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy demands. We used flow cytometry to identify a unique low mitochondrial activity/glycolysis-dependent subpopulation that houses the majority of hematopoietic progenitors and LT-HSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that Meis1 and Hif-1α are markedly enriched in LT-HSCs and that Meis1 regulates HSC metabolism through transcriptional activation of Hif-1α.

The current model implicates that the first lineage commitment step of adult pluripotent HSCs results in a strict separation into common lymphoid and common myeloid precursors. We present evidence for a population of cells which, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to adopt erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage fates. Cells in the Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3− HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression.

	abstract = {Despite great advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying blood production, lineage specification at the level of multipotent progenitors (MPPs) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MPP2 and MPP3 are distinct myeloid-biased MPP subsets that work together with lymphoid-primed MPP4 cells to control blood production. We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

Combined readouts of cell lineage and cell state from the same cell mitigate the need to prospectively isolate populations of interest, and allow a system-level understanding of dynamic developmental processes. We will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these technologies, the intriguing discoveries that stemmed from lineage tracing hematopoiesis at the single-cell level and the directions toward which the field is moving. RECENT FINDINGS: Single-cell lineage tracing studies unveiled extensive functional heterogeneity within discrete immunophenotypic populations. Recently, several groups merged lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing to visualize clonal relationships directly on transcriptional landscapes without the requirement for prospective isolation of cell types by FACS. To study the cell dynamics of hematopoiesis, without perturbation in their native niche, researchers have developed mouse models with endogenous single-cell lineage tracing systems, which can simultaneously trace thousands of hematopoietic progenitor cells in a single mouse, without transplantation. The emerging picture is that multiple hematopoietic hierarchies coexist within a single individual, each with distinct regulatory features. These hierarchies are imprinted during development much earlier than previously predicted, persisting well into adulthood and even after injury and transplantation. SUMMARY: Clone-tracking experiments allow stem-cell researchers to characterize lineage hierarchies during blood development and regeneration. Combined with single-cell genomics analyses, these studies are allowing system-level description of hematopoiesis in mice and humans. Early exploratory studies have unveiled features with important implications for human biology and disease. VIDEO ABSTRACT:},

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

In acute myeloid leukemias this balance is perturbed, locking cells into an immature, potentially ‘immortal’ state. Enhanced expression of miR-194-5p by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or by exogenous miR-194-5p expression re-sensitizes cells to differentiation and apoptosis by inducing BCLAF1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance was found commonly deregulated in 60 primary acute myeloid leukemia patients and was largely restored by ex vivo SAHA treatment. Our findings link treatment responsiveness to re-instatement of miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance.},

This study reports a role for the transcription factor FOG-1 in specification of preMegEs, while GATA-1 is subsequently required for erythroid-lineage commitment., The transcription factors that control lineage specification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been well described for the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, whereas transcriptional control of erythroid (E) and megakaryocytic (Mk) fate is less understood. We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

	abstract = {Subversion of transcription factor (TF) activity in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to the development of therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that drive fulminant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product2,3,4,5,6. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

We detected increased transcriptional activation in aged HSCs, further confirmed by chromatin accessibility analysis. Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow. We share our results as an online resource and demonstrate its utility by confirming that exposure to sympathomimetics, and deletion of Dnmt3a/b, molecularly resembles HSC rejuvenation or aging, respectively.},

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

First, a cascade of lineage-affiliated gene expression signatures, primed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and differentially propagated in lineage-restricted progenitors, was identified. Lymphoid transcripts were primed as early as the HSC, together with myeloid and erythroid transcripts. Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC. Taken together, our studies provide new insight into the priming and restriction of lineage potentials during early hematopoiesis and identify Ikaros as a key bivalent regulator of this process.},

Here we show that hematopoietic progenitors can be reprogrammed by the instructive action of GATA-1. Enforced expression of GATA-1 in hematopoietic stem cells led to loss of self-renewal activity and the exclusive generation of MegE lineages. Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

We previously identified an upstream regulatory cis element whose targeted deletion in mice decreases PU.1 expression and causes leukemia. We show here that the upstream regulatory cis element alone is insufficient to confer physiologic PU.1 expression in mice but requires the cooperation with other, previously unidentified elements. Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation. In this model, PU.1 regulates its expression in B cells and macrophages by differentially associating with cell type-specific transcription factors at one of its cis-regulatory elements to establish differential activity patterns at other elements.},

We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

	abstract = {Fli-1 is a proto-oncogene which is rearranged in tumors induced by three different retroviruses, Cas-Br-E, F-MuLV, and 10A1. This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Ikaros regulates the development of hematopoietic cells. Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1432147100},
	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1.

After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior.

We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival.

Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.},

	abstract = {Addition of chemical tags on the DNA and modification of histone proteins impart a distinct feature on chromatin architecture. With the advancement in scientific research, the key players underlying these changes have been identified as epigenetic modifiers of the chromatin. Indeed, the plethora of enzymes catalyzing these modifications, portray the diversity of epigenetic space and the intricacy in regulating gene expression. These epigenetic players are categorized as writers: that introduce various chemical modifications on DNA and histones, readers: the specialized domain containing proteins that identify and interpret those modifications and erasers: the dedicated group of enzymes proficient in removing these chemical tags. Research over the past few decades has established that these epigenetic tools are associated with numerous disease conditions especially cancer. Besides, with the involvement of epigenetics in cancer, these enzymes and protein domains provide new targets for cancer drug development. This is certain from the volume of epigenetic research conducted in universities and R\&D sector of pharmaceutical industry. Here we have highlighted the different types of epigenetic enzymes and protein domains with an emphasis on methylation and acetylation. This review also deals with the recent developments in small molecule inhibitors as potential anti-cancer drugs targeting the epigenetic space.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

Cells in the Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3− HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression.

We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment.

Enhanced expression of miR-194-5p by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or by exogenous miR-194-5p expression re-sensitizes cells to differentiation and apoptosis by inducing BCLAF1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance was found commonly deregulated in 60 primary acute myeloid leukemia patients and was largely restored by ex vivo SAHA treatment.

By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Gata1 is expressed in several hematopoietic lineages and plays essential roles in normal hematopoietic development during embryonic stages. The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product2,3,4,5,6. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors are master regulatory switches of differentiation, including the development of specific hematopoietic lineages from stem cells. Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow. We share our results as an online resource and demonstrate its utility by confirming that exposure to sympathomimetics, and deletion of Dnmt3a/b, molecularly resembles HSC rejuvenation or aging, respectively.},

Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC. Taken together, our studies provide new insight into the priming and restriction of lineage potentials during early hematopoiesis and identify Ikaros as a key bivalent regulator of this process.},

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {The PU.1 gene contains a 237-base pair distal enhancer located 14 kilobases upstream of its promoter. We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

However, little is known of how this tissue-specific pattern is established. We previously identified an upstream regulatory cis element whose targeted deletion in mice decreases PU.1 expression and causes leukemia. We show here that the upstream regulatory cis element alone is insufficient to confer physiologic PU.1 expression in mice but requires the cooperation with other, previously unidentified elements. Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation. In this model, PU.1 regulates its expression in B cells and macrophages by differentially associating with cell type-specific transcription factors at one of its cis-regulatory elements to establish differential activity patterns at other elements.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

Here we show that hematopoietic progenitors can be reprogrammed by the instructive action of GATA-1. Enforced expression of GATA-1 in hematopoietic stem cells led to loss of self-renewal activity and the exclusive generation of MegE lineages. Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

In cell culture, FOG cooperates with the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Ikaros regulates the development of hematopoietic cells. Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1432147100},
	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1.

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior.

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

	abstract = {EGR1 is a member of the immediate early response transcription factor family and functions in cell growth, development, and stress responses in many tissues. Here we report an additional role for EGR1 in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

Here, we show that junB inactivation deregulates the cell-cycle machinery and increases the proliferation of long-term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs) without impairing their self-renewal or regenerative potential in vivo. We found that JunB loss destabilizes a complex network of genes and pathways that normally limit myeloid differentiation, leading to impaired responsiveness to both Notch and TGF-beta signaling due in part to transcriptional deregulation of the Hes1 gene. These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.},

Previous studies have identified p21 and Egr3 as intrinsic factors responsible for the growth arrest and differentiation blockade of normal HSCs in leukemia; however, the related extrinsic factors remain unknown. In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein. We also found that SMAD3, a signal transducer of TGFβ1, directly bound to Egr3 and upregulated its expression to arrest proliferation of HSCs.

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

Because HSCs must persist for a lifetime, the balance between their proliferation and quiescence is carefully regulated to ensure blood homeostasis while limiting cellular damage. Cell cycle regulation therefore plays a critical role in controlling HSC function during both fetal life and in the adult. The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment. This fine-tuned regulatory network may become altered with age, leading to aberrant HSC cell cycle regulation, degraded HSC function, and hematological malignancy.},

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

However, the developmental branching points between these two large cell compartments are still controversial, and little is known about how their diversification is induced. Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments.

We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Disruption of these HSC cell fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia. Transcription factors have emerged as critical regulators in this respect.

Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.},

Here we report an additional role for EGR1 in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein.

Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

However, the developmental branching points between these two large cell compartments are still controversial, and little is known about how their diversification is induced. Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {\textless}2 h.},

Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

	abstract = {The aging hematopoietic system undergoes numerous changes, including reduced production of red blood cells and lymphocytes as well as a relative increase in the production of myeloid cells. Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice. Collectively, Bmi1 regulates self-renewing HSCs in both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous manners.},

Members of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (p21, p27, p57) have been implicated in HSC quiescence, but loss of p21 or p27 in mice affects HSC quiescence or functionality only under conditions of stress. Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus. Our results therefore suggest that, among Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitors, p57 plays a predominant role in the quiescence and maintenance of adult HSCs.},

CDK4/6 are rendered hyperactive in the majority of human cancers through a multitude of genomic alterations. Sustained activation of these protein kinases provides cancer cells with the power to enter the cell cycle continuously by triggering G1-S-phase transitions and dramatically shortening the duration of the G1 phase. It has also become clear, however, that CDK4/6 effectively counter cancer cell-intrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms, senescence and apoptosis, which must be overcome during cell transformation and kept at bay throughout all stages of tumorigenesis. As a central 'node' in cellular signaling networks, cyclin D-dependent kinases sense a plethora of mitogenic signals to orchestrate specific transcriptional programs. As the complexity of the cellular signaling network regulated by these oncogenic kinases unfolds, much remains to be learned about its architecture, its dynamics and the consequences of its perturbation.},

	abstract = {Transplantation-associated stress can compromise the hematopoietic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). As a consequence, HSCs may undergo "exhaustion" in serial transplant recipients, for which the cellular and molecular bases are not well understood. Hematopoietic exhaustion appears to be accelerated in the absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) in irradiated hosts. Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

We also assessed the expression of several “stem cell” genes in corresponding populations of highly purified HSCs. Fetal and adult HSCs displayed marked differences in their self-renewal, differentiated cell output, and gene expression properties, with persistence of a fetal phenotype until 3 weeks after birth. Then, 1 week later, the HSCs became functionally indistinguishable from adult HSCs. The same schedule of changes in HSC properties occurred when HSCs from fetal or 3-week-old donors were transplanted into adult recipients.

However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

Here we show that in mice, all HSCs are cycling until 3 weeks after birth. Then, within 1 week, most became quiescent. Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development. They also suggest an ability of HSCs to express CXCL12 in a fashion that changes with cell cycle progression and is associated with a defective engraftment that can be overcome by in vivo administration of a CXCL12 antagonist.},

How HSCs accommodate the diverse cellular stresses associated with their life-long activity remains elusive. Here we identify autophagy as an essential mechanism protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. We show that mouse HSCs, in contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival. Our results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system.},

Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis.

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs.

Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed.

Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow.

Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified.

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

Here we show that hematopoietic progenitors can be reprogrammed by the instructive action of GATA-1.

Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals.

We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

We show here that the upstream regulatory cis element alone is insufficient to confer physiologic PU.1 expression in mice but requires the cooperation with other, previously unidentified elements. Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation. In this model, PU.1 regulates its expression in B cells and macrophages by differentially associating with cell type-specific transcription factors at one of its cis-regulatory elements to establish differential activity patterns at other elements.},

We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {Fli-1 is a proto-oncogene which is rearranged in tumors induced by three different retroviruses, Cas-Br-E, F-MuLV, and 10A1. This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1.

The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

	abstract = {EGR1 is a member of the immediate early response transcription factor family and functions in cell growth, development, and stress responses in many tissues. Here we report an additional role for EGR1 in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

We found that JunB loss destabilizes a complex network of genes and pathways that normally limit myeloid differentiation, leading to impaired responsiveness to both Notch and TGF-beta signaling due in part to transcriptional deregulation of the Hes1 gene. These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.},

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein. We also found that SMAD3, a signal transducer of TGFβ1, directly bound to Egr3 and upregulated its expression to arrest proliferation of HSCs.

Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

	abstract = {Predicting biological systems’ behaviors requires taking into account many molecular and genetic elements for which limited information is available past a global knowledge of their pairwise interactions. Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment.

Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments.

We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control.

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells.

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle.

Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

Enhanced expression of miR-194-5p by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or by exogenous miR-194-5p expression re-sensitizes cells to differentiation and apoptosis by inducing BCLAF1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance was found commonly deregulated in 60 primary acute myeloid leukemia patients and was largely restored by ex vivo SAHA treatment.

This study reports a role for the transcription factor FOG-1 in specification of preMegEs, while GATA-1 is subsequently required for erythroid-lineage commitment., The transcription factors that control lineage specification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been well described for the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, whereas transcriptional control of erythroid (E) and megakaryocytic (Mk) fate is less understood. We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

	abstract = {The activity of adult stem cells is essential to replenish mature cells constantly lost due to normal tissue turnover. By a poorly understood mechanism, stem cells are maintained through self-renewal while concomitantly producing differentiated progeny. Here, we provide genetic evidence for an unexpected function of the c-Myc protein in the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs. Collectively, our data indicate that c-Myc controls the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, presumably by regulating the interaction between HSCs and their niche.},

Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor Gata1 is expressed in several hematopoietic lineages and plays essential roles in normal hematopoietic development during embryonic stages. The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

	abstract = {The production of blood cells is sustained throughout the lifetime of an individual by haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1. Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product2,3,4,5,6. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets.

We used kBET to assess commonly used batch-regression and normalization approaches, and to quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations.

These large-scale efforts were largely enabled through the understanding that enhancers share certain stereotypical chromatin features. However, an important question still lingers: what is the functional significance of enhancer chromatin modification?

The hematopoietic system includes dozens of distinct, transcriptionally coherent cell types, including intermediate transitional populations that have not been previously described at a molecular level. Using the first data release from the HCA bone marrow tissue project, we resolved common, rare, and potentially transitional cell populations from over 100,000 hematopoietic cells spanning 35 transcriptionally coherent groups across eight healthy donors using emerging new computational approaches. These data highlight novel mixed-lineage progenitor populations and putative trajectories governing granulocytic, monocytic, lymphoid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and eosinophil specification. Our analyses suggest significant variation in cell-type composition and gene expression among donors, including biological processes affected by donor age. To enable broad exploration of these findings, we provide an interactive website to probe intra-cell and extra-cell population differences within and between donors and reference markers for cellular classification and cellular trajectories through associated progenitor states.},

To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively.

These new strategies are enabled by advances in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic technologies.

We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating.

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility.

	abstract = {Bone marrow transplantation therapy relies on the life-long regenerative capacity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1,2. HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined3-11. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

However, this model is based on the analysis of predefined flow-sorted cell populations. Here we integrated flow cytometric, transcriptomic and functional data at single-cell resolution to quantitatively map early differentiation of human HSCs towards lineage commitment. During homeostasis, individual HSCs gradually acquire lineage biases along multiple directions without passing through discrete hierarchically organized progenitor populations. Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis.

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

However, with age, the balance is disrupted, and LT-HSCs produce a myeloid-biased output, resulting in poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. We have therefore identified and isolated an LT-HSC subset that regulates myeloid versus lymphoid balance under inflammatory challenge and with age.},

	abstract = {Haematopoiesis, the process of mature blood and immune cell production, is functionally organized as a hierarchy, with self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells sitting at the very top. Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells. Our study provides evidence for a substantially revised roadmap for unperturbed haematopoiesis, and highlights unique properties of multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells in situ.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

To resolve subtle transcriptome differences indicative of lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias in progenitor populations. Here we used FateID to delineate domains of fate bias and enable the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, thereby revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays.

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state.

At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice.

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc.

	abstract = {Highly proliferative tissues such as the gut, skin, and bone marrow lose millions of cells each day to normal attrition and challenge from different biological adversities. To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

	abstract = {The functional potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) declines during aging, and in doing so, significantly contributes to hematopoietic pathophysiology in the elderly. To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

However, single cell transplantation assays revealed that the sustained expression of Bmi1 augmented the multi-lineage repopulating capacity of aged HSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs.

The in vivo function of p21 in the context of telomere dysfunction is unknown. Here we show that deletion of p21 prolongs the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. p21 deletion improved hematolymphopoiesis and the maintenance of intestinal epithelia without rescuing telomere function. Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation. This study provides experimental evidence that telomere dysfunction induces p21-dependent checkpoints in vivo that can limit longevity at the organismal level.},

Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs.

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity. As such, they question self-renewal as a characteristic of homeostatic, nonperturbed HSCs in contrast to self-renewal demonstrated under stress conditions.},

To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

The immense regenerative capacity of the hematopoietic system is provided by a distinct type of adult stem cell: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although blood cells have to be produced continuously throughout life, the HSC pool seems not to be spared by aging processes. Indeed, limited expression of telomerase is not sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in these cells, which is thought ultimately to limit their proliferative capacity. In this review, we discuss the relevance of telomere maintenance for the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and consider potential functions of telomerase in this context.

While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

Surprisingly, our studies demonstrate that conditional Smoothened (Smo) deletion or over-activation has no significant effects on adult HSC self-renewal and function. Moreover, they indicate a lack of synergism between the Notch and Hh pathways in HSC function, as compound RBPJ- and Smo-deficiency does not affect hematopoiesis. In agreement with this notion, detailed genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that silencing of Hh signaling does not significantly alter the HSC-specific gene expression “signature”.

Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

Despite the well-established longevity that is a prerequisite for such function, accumulating data argue for compromised stem cell function with age. Identifying the mechanisms underlying age-dependent stem cell dysfunction is therefore key to understanding the aging process. Here, using a model carrying a proofreading-defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase, we demonstrate hematopoietic defects reminiscent of premature HSC aging, including anemia, lymphopenia, and myeloid lineage skewing. However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors. These results show that intact mitochondrial function is required for appropriate multilineage stem cell differentiation, but argue against mitochondrial DNA mutations per se being a primary driver of somatic stem cell aging.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

Here we show that the Wnt signalling pathway has an important role in this process. Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. We conclude that the Wnt signalling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.},

Notably, in the absence of p16INK4a, HSC repopulating defects and apoptosis were mitigated, improving the stress tolerance of cells and the survival of animals in successive transplants, a stem-cell-autonomous tissue regeneration model.

Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGF-β signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Altogether, these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior.

Dnmt3a-null HSCs upregulate HSC multipotency genes and downregulate differentiation factors, and their progeny exhibit global hypomethylation and incomplete repression of HSC-specific genes.

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline.

Though the mouse HSC population has been shown to change both quantitatively and functionally with age, changes in the human HSC and progenitor cell populations during aging have been incompletely characterized. To elucidate the properties of an aged human hematopoietic system that may predispose to age-associated hematopoietic dysfunction, we evaluated immunophenotypic HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor populations from healthy, hematologically normal young and elderly human bone marrow samples. We found that aged immunophenotypic human HSC increase in frequency, are less quiescent, and exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation potential compared with young HSC. Gene expression profiling revealed that aged immunophenotypic human HSC transcriptionally up-regulate genes associated with cell cycle, myeloid lineage specification, and myeloid malignancies. These age-associated alterations in the frequency, developmental potential, and gene expression profile of human HSC are similar to those changes observed in mouse HSC, suggesting that hematopoietic aging is an evolutionarily conserved process.},

We recently hypothesized that one underlying cause of altered hematopoiesis in aging might be due to altered interactions of aged stem cells with the microenvironment/niche. We developed time-lapse 2-photon microscopy and novel image analysis algorithms to quantify the dynamics of young and aged hematopoietic cells inside the marrow of long bones of mice in vivo. We report in this study that aged early hematopoietic progenitor cells (eHPCs) present with increased cell protrusion movement in vivo and localize more distantly to the endosteum compared with young eHPCs. This correlated with reduced adhesion to stroma cells as well as reduced cell polarity upon adhesion of aged eHPCs. These data support a role of altered eHPC dynamics and altered cell polarity, and thus altered niche biology in mechanisms of mammalian aging.},

Predictions of donor contributions from models assuming different levels of donor HSC functional ability and concentration were compared to actual observations. The model with the least difference between predictions and observations was accepted. In BALB/ cBy (BALB) mice, models assuming equal functional ability of HSC from the same donor fit extremely well with actual observations, suggesting that all HSC are functionally homogeneous at any particular time point during development or aging. Relative HSC functional ability per cell declined during development, so that a fetal HSC had 1.6 to 3.0 times the functional ability of a young adult HSC. The decline continued with age, so that a young adult HSC had 1.6 to 2.0 times the functional ability of an old HSC. Concentrations of HSC that engrafted and functioned were similar among 16-day fetal liver cells and bone marrow cells (BMC) from 3-month and 25 to 28-month-old adult mice. They were either 10 or 4 HSC per million cells when tested in BALB or CByB6F1 recipients, respectively. All HSC were pluripotent and produced lymphoid and myeloid descendants proportionally (r = 0.80 to 0.98, p {\textless} 0.01). Fetal and young HSC in both types of recipients maintained clonal stability long term so that percentages of donor cells at 6 and 9 months were strongly correlated (r = 0.72 to 0.93, p {\textless} 0.01). Although HSC from aged donors in BALB recipients maintained clonal stability, HSC from the same aged donors failed to show clonal stability in CByB6F1 recipients, perhaps due to the less suitable host environment.

Old HSCs had a twofold reduction in marrow-homing efficiency and a similar decrease in functional frequency as measured using long-term transplantation assays. Similarly, old HSCs had a twofold reduced seeding efficiency and a significantly delayed proliferative response compared with young HSCs in long-term stromal cell co-cultures but were indistinguishable in suspension cultures. We show that these functional defects are characteristics of most or all old HSCs and are not indicative of a nonfunctional subset of cells that express HSC markers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cells with functional properties of old HSCs can be generated directly from young HSCs by extended serial transplantation, which is consistent with the possibility that they arise through a process of cellular aging.},

HSCs were five times as frequent in the bone marrow of old mice; however, HSCs from old mice were only one-quarter as efficient at homing to and engrafting the bone marrow of irradiated recipients. HSCs in young and middle-aged mice rarely were in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle, but HSCs in old mice were frequently in cycle. We speculate that the unexpected proliferation of HSCs in old mice might be related to the increased incidence of leukemia in old mice. HSCs change with age, but it is unknown whether these changes are determined intrinsically or caused by the aging of their environment.},

	abstract = {In this paper we extend the "network theory of aging," and we argue that a global reduction in the capacity to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status are major characteristics of the aging process. This phenomenon, which we will refer to as "inflamm-aging," is provoked by a continuous antigenic load and stress. On the basis of evolutionary studies, we also argue that the immune and the stress responses are equivalent and that antigens are nothing other than particular types of stressors. We also propose to return macrophage to its rightful place as central actor not only in the inflammatory response and immunity, but also in the stress response. The rate of reaching the threshold of proinflammatory status over which diseases/disabilities ensue and the individual capacity to cope with and adapt to stressors are assumed to be complex traits with a genetic component. Finally, we argue that the persistence of inflammatory stimuli over time represents the biologic background (first hit) favoring the susceptibility to age-related diseases/disabilities. A second hit (absence of robust gene variants and/or presence of frail gene variants) is likely necessary to develop overt organ-specific age-related diseases having an inflammatory pathogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Following this perspective, several paradoxes of healthy centenarians (increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and coagulation factors) are illustrated and explained. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of inflammation devoted to the neutralization of dangerous/harmful agents early in life and in adulthood become detrimental late in life in a period largely not foreseen by evolution, according to the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.},

Due to the complex and multi-factorial nature of both aging and cancer, accurate deciphering of causative links between aging and cancer remains a major challenge. It is generally accepted that initiation and progression of cancers are driven by a process of clonal evolution. In principle, this somatic evolution should follow the same Darwinian logic as evolutionary processes in populations in nature: diverse heritable types arising as a result of mutations are subjected to selection, resulting in expansion of the fittest clones. However, prevalent paradigms focus primarily on mutational aspects in linking aging and cancer. In this review, we will argue that age-related changes in selective pressures are likely to be equally important. We will focus on aging-related changes in the hematopoietic system, where age-associated alterations are relatively well studied, and discuss the impact of these changes on the development of leukemias and other malignancies.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

Combined readouts of cell lineage and cell state from the same cell mitigate the need to prospectively isolate populations of interest, and allow a system-level understanding of dynamic developmental processes. We will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these technologies, the intriguing discoveries that stemmed from lineage tracing hematopoiesis at the single-cell level and the directions toward which the field is moving. RECENT FINDINGS: Single-cell lineage tracing studies unveiled extensive functional heterogeneity within discrete immunophenotypic populations. Recently, several groups merged lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing to visualize clonal relationships directly on transcriptional landscapes without the requirement for prospective isolation of cell types by FACS. To study the cell dynamics of hematopoiesis, without perturbation in their native niche, researchers have developed mouse models with endogenous single-cell lineage tracing systems, which can simultaneously trace thousands of hematopoietic progenitor cells in a single mouse, without transplantation. The emerging picture is that multiple hematopoietic hierarchies coexist within a single individual, each with distinct regulatory features. These hierarchies are imprinted during development much earlier than previously predicted, persisting well into adulthood and even after injury and transplantation. SUMMARY: Clone-tracking experiments allow stem-cell researchers to characterize lineage hierarchies during blood development and regeneration. Combined with single-cell genomics analyses, these studies are allowing system-level description of hematopoiesis in mice and humans. Early exploratory studies have unveiled features with important implications for human biology and disease. VIDEO ABSTRACT:},

Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks.},

Enhanced expression of miR-194-5p by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or by exogenous miR-194-5p expression re-sensitizes cells to differentiation and apoptosis by inducing BCLAF1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance was found commonly deregulated in 60 primary acute myeloid leukemia patients and was largely restored by ex vivo SAHA treatment.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

By a poorly understood mechanism, stem cells are maintained through self-renewal while concomitantly producing differentiated progeny.

Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs. Collectively, our data indicate that c-Myc controls the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, presumably by regulating the interaction between HSCs and their niche.},

Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product2,3,4,5,6. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000268},
	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

First, a cascade of lineage-affiliated gene expression signatures, primed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and differentially propagated in lineage-restricted progenitors, was identified. Lymphoid transcripts were primed as early as the HSC, together with myeloid and erythroid transcripts. Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC. Taken together, our studies provide new insight into the priming and restriction of lineage potentials during early hematopoiesis and identify Ikaros as a key bivalent regulator of this process.},

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

	abstract = {The PU.1 gene contains a 237-base pair distal enhancer located 14 kilobases upstream of its promoter. We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

We show here that the upstream regulatory cis element alone is insufficient to confer physiologic PU.1 expression in mice but requires the cooperation with other, previously unidentified elements. Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation. In this model, PU.1 regulates its expression in B cells and macrophages by differentially associating with cell type-specific transcription factors at one of its cis-regulatory elements to establish differential activity patterns at other elements.},

In cell culture, FOG cooperates with the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

	abstract = {Fli-1 is a proto-oncogene which is rearranged in tumors induced by three different retroviruses, Cas-Br-E, F-MuLV, and 10A1. This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGFβ signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes, and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior.

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

Inactivation of JunB in postnatal mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) resembling early human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Here, we show that JunB regulates the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.},

We found that JunB loss destabilizes a complex network of genes and pathways that normally limit myeloid differentiation, leading to impaired responsiveness to both Notch and TGF-beta signaling due in part to transcriptional deregulation of the Hes1 gene. These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.},

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

Disruption of these HSC cell fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia. Transcription factors have emerged as critical regulators in this respect.

HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein. We also found that SMAD3, a signal transducer of TGFβ1, directly bound to Egr3 and upregulated its expression to arrest proliferation of HSCs. Our study provides evidence for targeting TGFβ1 in AML to rectify normal hematopoiesis defects in clinical practice.},

Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application.

The decrease of immune cell production during aging is one of the features of immunosenescence. The impact of redox dysregulation in BM aging is still poorly understood. Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

Here we found that, after mitochondrial activation with replication, HSCs irreversibly remodel the mitochondrial network and that this network is not repaired after HSC re-entry into quiescence, contrary to hematopoietic progenitors. HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division. Thus, loss of fidelity of mitochondrial morphology and segregation is one type of HSC divisional memory and drives HSC attrition.},

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

	abstract = {It is long known that stem cell differentiation correlates with a lengthening of the cell cycle, in particular G1. Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

Here, we integrate data from HSC fate mapping and cell-cycle-dependent labeling through mathematical inference and thus gain insight into how HSCs coordinate self-renewal with differentiation. We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes. This stem cell hierarchy precedes lineage differentiation and may limit mutation accumulation in the hematopoietic system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

ACD has previously been shown to dictate or influence many aspects of development in model organisms such as the worm and the fly, and to be disrupted in disease. Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and suggest approaches to definitively test the physiological role of ACD in lymphocytes.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

The relative asymmetry between self-renewal and differentiation in balance with apoptosis determines the size and durability of a stem-cell pool. Regulation of the cell cycle is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying determination of cell fate. Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

As a consequence, HSCs may undergo "exhaustion" in serial transplant recipients, for which the cellular and molecular bases are not well understood. Hematopoietic exhaustion appears to be accelerated in the absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) in irradiated hosts. Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.

Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus.

However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

	abstract = {The regulation of HSC proliferation and engraftment of the BM is an important but poorly understood process, particularly during ontogeny. Here we show that in mice, all HSCs are cycling until 3 weeks after birth. Then, within 1 week, most became quiescent. Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development. They also suggest an ability of HSCs to express CXCL12 in a fashion that changes with cell cycle progression and is associated with a defective engraftment that can be overcome by in vivo administration of a CXCL12 antagonist.},

Because HSCs must persist for a lifetime, the balance between their proliferation and quiescence is carefully regulated to ensure blood homeostasis while limiting cellular damage. Cell cycle regulation therefore plays a critical role in controlling HSC function during both fetal life and in the adult. The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment. This fine-tuned regulatory network may become altered with age, leading to aberrant HSC cell cycle regulation, degraded HSC function, and hematological malignancy.},

We show that the Fli1+12 enhancer, like the Gata2-3 and Scl+19 enhancers, targets hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and relies on a combination of Ets, Gata, and E-Box motifs. We show that the Gata2-3 enhancer also uses a similar cluster of motifs and that Gata2, Fli1, and Scl are expressed in embryonic day-11.5 dorsal aorta where HSCs originate and in fetal liver where they multiply. The three HSC enhancers in these tissues and in ES cell-derived hemangioblast equivalents are bound by each of these transcription factors (TFs) and form a fully connected triad that constitutes a previously undescribed example of both this network motif in mammalian development and a GRN kernel operating during the specification of a mammalian stem cell.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

We found that the amount of protein synthesized per hour in HSCs in vivo was lower than in most other haematopoietic cells, even if we controlled for differences in cell cycle status or forced HSCs to undergo self-renewing divisions. Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.},

We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival.

This study reports a role for the transcription factor FOG-1 in specification of preMegEs, while GATA-1 is subsequently required for erythroid-lineage commitment., The transcription factors that control lineage specification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been well described for the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, whereas transcriptional control of erythroid (E) and megakaryocytic (Mk) fate is less understood. We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

Here, we show that MPP2 and MPP3 are distinct myeloid-biased MPP subsets that work together with lymphoid-primed MPP4 cells to control blood production. We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

Enhanced expression of miR-194-5p by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or by exogenous miR-194-5p expression re-sensitizes cells to differentiation and apoptosis by inducing BCLAF1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. miR-194-5p/BCLAF1 balance was found commonly deregulated in 60 primary acute myeloid leukemia patients and was largely restored by ex vivo SAHA treatment.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

By a poorly understood mechanism, stem cells are maintained through self-renewal while concomitantly producing differentiated progeny. Here, we provide genetic evidence for an unexpected function of the c-Myc protein in the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs. Collectively, our data indicate that c-Myc controls the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, presumably by regulating the interaction between HSCs and their niche.},

To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow.

By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors are master regulatory switches of differentiation, including the development of specific hematopoietic lineages from stem cells. Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC. Taken together, our studies provide new insight into the priming and restriction of lineage potentials during early hematopoiesis and identify Ikaros as a key bivalent regulator of this process.},

	issn = {0006-4971},
	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {The PU.1 gene contains a 237-base pair distal enhancer located 14 kilobases upstream of its promoter. We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages.

Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation.

Recent evidence suggests that their biologic activities may be modulated through interaction with multitype zinc finger proteins, such as Friend of GATA-1 (FOG) and U-shaped (Ush). In cell culture, FOG cooperates with the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

Both GATA-1 and GATA-2 are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner, their expression being strictly controlled during the development and differentiation of erythroid cells. Closer examination revealed a cross-regulatory mechanism by which GATA-1 can control the expression of GATA-2 and vice versa, possibly via essential GATA binding sites in their cis-acting elements.

	abstract = {Fli-1 is a proto-oncogene which is rearranged in tumors induced by three different retroviruses, Cas-Br-E, F-MuLV, and 10A1. This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

Using these progenitors and a conditionally activatable PU.1 protein, we show that PU.1 can negatively regulate expression of the GATA-2 gene. In the absence of GATA-2, PU.1 promotes macrophage but not mast cell differentiation. Reexpression of GATA-2 in such progenitors enables the generation of mast cells.

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1432147100},
	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

We show that both types of binding sites are required for full activity, and that the GATA motif at -60 is essential. The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1. These results suggest that EKLF is dependent on GATA-1 for its expression and lies downstream of, or coincident with, GATA-1 in a regulatory hierarchy in erythroid development.},

Several recently published methods combine transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression for target prediction, but few of them provide an efficient software package for the community. Binding and expression target analysis (BETA) is a software package that integrates ChIP-seq of TFs or chromatin regulators with differential gene expression data to infer direct target genes. BETA has three functions: (i) to predict whether the factor has activating or repressive function; (ii) to infer the factor's target genes; and (iii) to identify the motif of the factor and its collaborators, which might modulate the factor's activating or repressive function. Here we describe the implementation and features of BETA to demonstrate its application to several data sets. BETA requires {\textasciitilde}1 GB of RAM, and the procedure takes 20 min to complete.

After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

Disruption of these HSC cell fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia. Transcription factors have emerged as critical regulators in this respect.

Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.},

Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGFβ signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes, and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior. Ribosomal biogenesis emerged as a particular target of aging, with increased transcription of ribosomal protein and RNA genes, and hypomethylation of rRNA genes.

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.},

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study.

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein.

Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution.

	abstract = {Predicting biological systems’ behaviors requires taking into account many molecular and genetic elements for which limited information is available past a global knowledge of their pairwise interactions. Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

However, the developmental branching points between these two large cell compartments are still controversial, and little is known about how their diversification is induced. Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

	abstract = {This protocol explains how to perform a fast SCENIC analysis alongside standard best practices steps on single-cell RNA-sequencing data using software containers and Nextflow pipelines. SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {\textless}2 h.},

Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis.

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks.

We then applied them in conjunction with functional assays to track the dynamic changes of immunophenotypically purified HSCs in irradiated recipients within the first week after transplantation. Based on our transcriptional classifications, most homed HSCs in bone marrow and spleen became multipotent progenitors and, occasionally, some HSCs gave rise to megakaryocytic–erythroid or myeloid precursors. Parallel in vitro and in vivo functional experiments supported the paradigm of robust differentiation without substantial HSC expansion during the first week.

Thereafter, scRNA-seq was performed to distinguish transcriptional effects induced by gemcitabine/carboplatin. Gene expression was calculated and evaluated among cells within and between samples compared to untreated cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that the treatments effectively decrease cell proliferation, indicated by the proportion of cells in the G2M-phase dropping from 35\% in untreated cells to 14.3\% in treated cells.

However, whether cell division in HSCs precedes differentiation is unclear. To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

In this study, we observe an early and progressive loss of lymphoid-primed MPP cells (LMPP/MPP4) with aging, concomitant with expansion of HSCs. Transcriptome and in vitro functional analyses at the single-cell level reveal a concurrent increase in cycling of aging LMPP/MPP4 with loss of lymphoid priming and differentiation potential. Impaired lymphoid differentiation potential of aged LMPP/MPP4 is not rescued by transplantation into a young bone marrow microenvironment, demonstrating cell-autonomous changes in the MPP compartment with aging. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.},

Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias.

Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells.

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate.

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

Finally, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this approach for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions in another stem cell system.},

We developed a robotic miniaturized CEL-Seq2 implementation to carry out deep single-cell RNA-seq of ∼2,000 mouse hematopoietic progenitors enriched for lymphoid lineages, and used an improved clustering algorithm, RaceID3, to identify cell types. To resolve subtle transcriptome differences indicative of lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias in progenitor populations. Here we used FateID to delineate domains of fate bias and enable the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, thereby revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays. We expect that FateID will improve understanding of the process of cell fate choice in complex multi-lineage differentiation systems.},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations.

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc. Mice maintained on a vitamin A-free diet lose HSCs and show a disrupted re-entry into dormancy after exposure to inflammatory stress stimuli.

Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.

Cortical projection neurons (CPNs) over-migrated during embryogenesis, inducing abnormal thickness and laminar positioning of cortical layers. At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice. Our findings demonstrate crucial roles for Neurod2 in cortical development and function, whose alterations likely account for ASD and related symptoms in the newly defined NEUROD2 mutation syndrome.},

To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs. Our study reveals a new role for plzf in regulating HSC function that is linked to cell cycle regulation, and positions plzf as a key player in controlling HSC homeostasis.},

Here we show that deletion of p21 prolongs the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. p21 deletion improved hematolymphopoiesis and the maintenance of intestinal epithelia without rescuing telomere function. Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

However, single cell transplantation assays revealed that the sustained expression of Bmi1 augmented the multi-lineage repopulating capacity of aged HSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs.

Here we report that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a, the level of which was previously noted to increase in other cell types with age, accumulates and modulates specific age-associated HSC functions. Notably, in the absence of p16INK4a, HSC repopulating defects and apoptosis were mitigated, improving the stress tolerance of cells and the survival of animals in successive transplants, a stem-cell-autonomous tissue regeneration model.

Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments.

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew for life, thereby making them one of the few blood cells that truly age. Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

Here, using a model carrying a proofreading-defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase, we demonstrate hematopoietic defects reminiscent of premature HSC aging, including anemia, lymphopenia, and myeloid lineage skewing. However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors. These results show that intact mitochondrial function is required for appropriate multilineage stem cell differentiation, but argue against mitochondrial DNA mutations per se being a primary driver of somatic stem cell aging.},

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity. As such, they question self-renewal as a characteristic of homeostatic, nonperturbed HSCs in contrast to self-renewal demonstrated under stress conditions.},

To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

The immense regenerative capacity of the hematopoietic system is provided by a distinct type of adult stem cell: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although blood cells have to be produced continuously throughout life, the HSC pool seems not to be spared by aging processes. Indeed, limited expression of telomerase is not sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in these cells, which is thought ultimately to limit their proliferative capacity. In this review, we discuss the relevance of telomere maintenance for the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and consider potential functions of telomerase in this context.

While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs.

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

	abstract = {It is long known that stem cell differentiation correlates with a lengthening of the cell cycle, in particular G1. Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

Here, we integrate data from HSC fate mapping and cell-cycle-dependent labeling through mathematical inference and thus gain insight into how HSCs coordinate self-renewal with differentiation. We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes. This stem cell hierarchy precedes lineage differentiation and may limit mutation accumulation in the hematopoietic system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Several reports suggested that Hh signaling is an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and differentiation. Here we test this hypothesis in vivo using both gain- and loss-of-function Hh genetic models. Surprisingly, our studies demonstrate that conditional Smoothened (Smo) deletion or over-activation has no significant effects on adult HSC self-renewal and function. Moreover, they indicate a lack of synergism between the Notch and Hh pathways in HSC function, as compound RBPJ- and Smo-deficiency does not affect hematopoiesis. In agreement with this notion, detailed genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that silencing of Hh signaling does not significantly alter the HSC-specific gene expression “signature”. Our studies demonstrate that the Hh signaling pathway is dispensable for adult HSC function and suggest that the Hh pathway can be targeted in future clinical trials addressing the effect of Hh inhibition on leukemia-initiating cell maintenance.},

Here we found that, after mitochondrial activation with replication, HSCs irreversibly remodel the mitochondrial network and that this network is not repaired after HSC re-entry into quiescence, contrary to hematopoietic progenitors. HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division. Thus, loss of fidelity of mitochondrial morphology and segregation is one type of HSC divisional memory and drives HSC attrition.},

Pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 activity functionally rejuvenates aged HSCs, increases the percentage of polarized cells in an aged HSC population, and restores the level and spatial distribution of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation to a status similar to that seen in young HSCs. Our data therefore suggest a mechanistic role for Cdc42 activity in HSC biology and epigenetic regulation, and identify Cdc42 activity as a pharmacological target for ameliorating stem cell aging.},

In the last decade a new aspect of lymphocyte polarity, termed Asymmetric Cell Division (ACD), has attracted much attention. ACD has previously been shown to dictate or influence many aspects of development in model organisms such as the worm and the fly, and to be disrupted in disease. Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and suggest approaches to definitively test the physiological role of ACD in lymphocytes.},

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

	abstract = {Transplantation-associated stress can compromise the hematopoietic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). As a consequence, HSCs may undergo "exhaustion" in serial transplant recipients, for which the cellular and molecular bases are not well understood. Hematopoietic exhaustion appears to be accelerated in the absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) in irradiated hosts. Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

The same schedule of changes in HSC properties occurred when HSCs from fetal or 3-week-old donors were transplanted into adult recipients.

Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus.

Regulation of the cell cycle is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying determination of cell fate. Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice. Collectively, Bmi1 regulates self-renewing HSCs in both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous manners.},

However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

We show that the Fli1+12 enhancer, like the Gata2-3 and Scl+19 enhancers, targets hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and relies on a combination of Ets, Gata, and E-Box motifs. We show that the Gata2-3 enhancer also uses a similar cluster of motifs and that Gata2, Fli1, and Scl are expressed in embryonic day-11.5 dorsal aorta where HSCs originate and in fetal liver where they multiply. The three HSC enhancers in these tissues and in ES cell-derived hemangioblast equivalents are bound by each of these transcription factors (TFs) and form a fully connected triad that constitutes a previously undescribed example of both this network motif in mammalian development and a GRN kernel operating during the specification of a mammalian stem cell.},

Here we show that in mice, all HSCs are cycling until 3 weeks after birth. Then, within 1 week, most became quiescent. Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development. They also suggest an ability of HSCs to express CXCL12 in a fashion that changes with cell cycle progression and is associated with a defective engraftment that can be overcome by in vivo administration of a CXCL12 antagonist.},

Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division.

We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival.

Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.},

	abstract = {All blood cell lineages derive from a common hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). The current model implicates that the first lineage commitment step of adult pluripotent HSCs results in a strict separation into common lymphoid and common myeloid precursors. We present evidence for a population of cells which, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to adopt erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage fates. Cells in the Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3− HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression. Based on these observations, we propose a revised road map for adult blood lineage development.},

	abstract = {Despite great advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying blood production, lineage specification at the level of multipotent progenitors (MPPs) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MPP2 and MPP3 are distinct myeloid-biased MPP subsets that work together with lymphoid-primed MPP4 cells to control blood production. We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions.

	abstract = {Targeted disruption of the Fli1 gene results in embryonic lethality. To dissect the roles of functional domains in Fli1, we recently generated mutant Fli1 mice that express a truncated Fli1 protein (Fli1(ΔCTA)) that lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory (CTA) domain. Heterozygous Fli1(ΔCTA) mice are viable, while homozygous mice have reduced viability. Early postnatal lethality accounts for 30\% survival of homozygotes to adulthood. The peripheral blood of these viable Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) homozygous mice has reduced platelet numbers. Platelet aggregation and activation were also impaired and bleeding times significantly prolonged in these mutant mice. Analysis of mRNA from total bone marrow and purified megakaryocytes from Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice revealed downregulation of genes associated with megakaroyctic development, including c-mpl, gpIIb, gpIV, gpIX, PF4, NF-E2, MafG, and Rab27B. While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed. Collectively, these data showed for the first time a hemostatic defect associated with the loss of a specific functional domain of the transcription factor Fli1 and suggest previously unknown in vivo roles in megakaryocytic cell differentiation.},

Cebpa expression is evident in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB cells but is absent in proB and preB cells. We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that C/EBPα is required for Flt3+ CLP maturation into preproB cells and then for proliferative Cebpaint B/myeloid preproB cells to progress to Cebpalo B cell-restricted preproB cells and finally to Cebpaneg proB cells.},

Despite substantial heterogeneity between individual studies, we uncovered a core and robust HSC aging signature. We detected increased transcriptional activation in aged HSCs, further confirmed by chromatin accessibility analysis. Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow. We share our results as an online resource and demonstrate its utility by confirming that exposure to sympathomimetics, and deletion of Dnmt3a/b, molecularly resembles HSC rejuvenation or aging, respectively.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors are master regulatory switches of differentiation, including the development of specific hematopoietic lineages from stem cells. Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC. Taken together, our studies provide new insight into the priming and restriction of lineage potentials during early hematopoiesis and identify Ikaros as a key bivalent regulator of this process.},

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages.

GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {The PU.1 gene contains a 237-base pair distal enhancer located 14 kilobases upstream of its promoter. We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

However, little is known of how this tissue-specific pattern is established. We previously identified an upstream regulatory cis element whose targeted deletion in mice decreases PU.1 expression and causes leukemia. We show here that the upstream regulatory cis element alone is insufficient to confer physiologic PU.1 expression in mice but requires the cooperation with other, previously unidentified elements. Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation. In this model, PU.1 regulates its expression in B cells and macrophages by differentially associating with cell type-specific transcription factors at one of its cis-regulatory elements to establish differential activity patterns at other elements.},

In cell culture, FOG cooperates with the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor. We speculate that FOG and other FOG-like proteins serve as complex cofactors that act through both GATA-dependent and GATA-independent mechanisms.},

Using these progenitors and a conditionally activatable PU.1 protein, we show that PU.1 can negatively regulate expression of the GATA-2 gene. In the absence of GATA-2, PU.1 promotes macrophage but not mast cell differentiation. Reexpression of GATA-2 in such progenitors enables the generation of mast cells.

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

	abstract = {FLI-1 is an ETS family transcription factor which is overexpressed in Friend erythroleukemia and contributes to the blockage of differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.},

Closer examination revealed a cross-regulatory mechanism by which GATA-1 can control the expression of GATA-2 and vice versa, possibly via essential GATA binding sites in their cis-acting elements.

This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

We have studied the promoter of the EKLF gene and identified binding sites for the transcription factors GATA-1 and CCAAT-binding Protein 1 (CP1). We show that both types of binding sites are required for full activity, and that the GATA motif at -60 is essential. The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1. These results suggest that EKLF is dependent on GATA-1 for its expression and lies downstream of, or coincident with, GATA-1 in a regulatory hierarchy in erythroid development.},

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGFβ signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes, and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior. Ribosomal biogenesis emerged as a particular target of aging, with increased transcription of ribosomal protein and RNA genes, and hypomethylation of rRNA genes.

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia.

Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

	abstract = {The construction of models of biological networks from prior knowledge and experimental data often leads to a multitude of candidate models. Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

Here, we show that junB inactivation deregulates the cell-cycle machinery and increases the proliferation of long-term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs) without impairing their self-renewal or regenerative potential in vivo. We found that JunB loss destabilizes a complex network of genes and pathways that normally limit myeloid differentiation, leading to impaired responsiveness to both Notch and TGF-beta signaling due in part to transcriptional deregulation of the Hes1 gene. These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.},

	abstract = {Predicting biological systems’ behaviors requires taking into account many molecular and genetic elements for which limited information is available past a global knowledge of their pairwise interactions. Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

However, the developmental branching points between these two large cell compartments are still controversial, and little is known about how their diversification is induced. Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment.

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {\textless}2 h.},

Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks.

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

	abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

	abstract = {Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial to maintain lifelong production of all blood cells. Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

Joint profiling of accessible chromatin and RNA within the same cells would permit direct matching of transcriptional regulation to its outputs. Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell's transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis.},

These include opposing effects of Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to pathogens.

The study of ageing at the molecular level is complicated by varying decay characteristics and kinetics—both between and within organs—driven by intrinsic and extracellular factors. Emerging single-cell omics methods allow for molecular and spatial profiling of cells, and probing of regulatory states and cell-fate determination, thus providing promising tools for unravelling the heterogeneous process of ageing and making it amenable to intervention. These new strategies are enabled by advances in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic technologies. Combined with methods for proteome and metabolome analysis, single-cell techniques provide multidimensional, integrated data with unprecedented detail and throughput. Here, we provide an overview of the current state, and perspectives on the future, of this emerging field. We discuss how single-cell approaches can advance understanding of mechanisms underlying organismal ageing and aid in the development of interventions for ageing and ageing-associated diseases.},

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Mammals are composed of distinct cell type identities and tissue environments, but the influence of these cell identities and environments on the trajectory of aging in individual cells remains unclear. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on {\textgreater}50,000 individual cells across three tissues in young and old mice to allow for direct comparison of aging phenotypes across cell types. We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating. These results suggest that aging manifests with unique directionality and magnitude across the diverse cell identities in mammals.},

We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory.

	abstract = {Bone marrow transplantation therapy relies on the life-long regenerative capacity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1,2. HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined3-11. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

However, this model is based on the analysis of predefined flow-sorted cell populations. Here we integrated flow cytometric, transcriptomic and functional data at single-cell resolution to quantitatively map early differentiation of human HSCs towards lineage commitment. During homeostasis, individual HSCs gradually acquire lineage biases along multiple directions without passing through discrete hierarchically organized progenitor populations. Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis. These data reveal a continuous landscape of human steady-state haematopoiesis downstream of HSCs and provide a basis for the understanding of haematopoietic malignancies.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations.

	abstract = {Molecular changes underlying stem cell differentiation are of fundamental interest. scRNA-seq on murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their progeny MPP1 separated the cells into 3 main clusters with distinct features: active, quiescent, and an un-characterized cluster. Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

	abstract = {The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation.In this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses.The R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODESupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It is reported that the accuracy of current methods at genome scale significantly drops from Escherichia coli to Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to the increase in number of genes. This limits the applicability of current methods to more complex genomes, like human and mouse. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is widely used for gene regulatory network inference from gene expression profiles. However, the accuracy of LASSO on large genomes is not satisfactory. In this study, we apply two extended models of LASSO, L0 and L1/2 regularization models to infer gene regulatory network from both high-throughput gene expression data and transcription factor binding data in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We find that both the L0 and L1/2 regularization models significantly outperform LASSO in network inference. Incorporating interactions between transcription factors and their targets remarkably improved the prediction accuracy. Current study demonstrates the efficiency and applicability of these two models for gene regulatory network inference from integrative omics data in large genomes. The applications of the two models will facilitate biologists to study the gene regulation of higher model organisms in a genome-wide scale.},

The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using single cell transcriptional profiles is particularly challenging, especially when directed gene-gene relationships are desired.We developed SINCERITIES (SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS) for the inference of GRNs from single cell transcriptional profiles. We focused on time-stamped cross-sectional expression data, commonly generated from transcriptional profiling of single cells collected at multiple time points after cell stimulation. SINCERITIES recovers directed regulatory relationships among genes by employing regularized linear regression (ridge regression), using temporal changes in the distributions of gene expressions. Meanwhile, the modes of the gene regulations (activation and repression) come from partial correlation analyses between pairs of genes. We demonstrated the efficacy of SINCERITIES in inferring GRNs using in silico time-stamped single cell expression data and single cell transcriptional profiles of THP-1 monocytic human leukemia cells. The case studies showed that SINCERITIES could provide accurate GRN predictions, significantly better than other GRN inference algorithms such as TSNI, GENIE3 and JUMP3. Moreover, SINCERITIES has a low computational complexity and is amenable to problems of extremely large dimensionality. Finally, an application of SINCERITIES to single cell expression data of T2EC chicken erythrocytes pointed to BATF as a candidate novel regulator of erythroid development.MATLAB and R version of SINCERITIES are freely available from the following websites: http://www.cabsel.ethz.ch/tools/sincerities.html and https://github.com/CABSEL/SINCERITIES. The single cell THP-1 and T2EC transcriptional profiles are available from the original publications (Kouno et al., 2013; Richard et al., 2016). The in silico single cell data are available on SINCERITIES websites.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we use multivariate information theory to explore the statistical dependencies between triplets of genes in single-cell gene expression datasets. We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher-order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell datasets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference. PIDC tutorials and open-source software for estimating PID are available. PIDC should facilitate the identification of putative functional relationships and mechanistic hypotheses from single-cell transcriptomic data.},

	abstract = {One of the pressing open problems of computational systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high throughput genomic data, in particular microarray gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.
            Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

Latest advances in this field have enabled the development of novel strategies that significantly increase both sensitivity and high throughput. In this review, we emphasize emerging techniques aimed at assessing individual or multiomic parameters at single-cell resolution and analyze how these technologies have helped us understand hematopoietic variability and identify unknown and/or rare subpopulations. We also summarize the impact of these single-cell profiling strategies on the characterization of cell diversity within the tumor and the clonal evolution of multiple hematological malignancies in samples from untreated and treated patients, which provide valuable information for diagnosis, prognosis, and future treatments and explain why current therapies may fail.

Among them, the most well characterized subtype is MDS with isolated chromosome 5q deletion (MDS del(5q)), which is the only one defined by a cytogenetic abnormality that makes these patients candidates to be treated with lenalidomide. During the last decade, single cell (SC) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to decipher clonal architecture and to further understand cancer and other diseases at higher resolution level compared to bulk sequencing techniques. In this study, a SC approach was used to analyze intratumoral heterogeneity in four patients with MDS del(5q). Single CD34+CD117+CD45+CD19- bone marrow hematopoietic stem progenitor cells were isolated using the C1 system (Fluidigm) from diagnosis or before receiving any treatment and from available follow-up samples. Selected somatic alterations were further analyzed in SC by high-throughput qPCR (Biomark HD, Fluidigm) using specific TaqMan assays. A median of 175 cells per sample were analyzed. Inferred clonal architectures were relatively simple and either linear or branching. Similar to previous studies based on bulk sequencing to infer clonal architecture, we were able to observe that an ancestral event in one patient can appear as a secondary hit in another one, thus reflecting the high intratumoral heterogeneity in MDS del(5q) and the importance of patient-specific molecular characterization.},

We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T cell activity in vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies.

	abstract = {Employing flow cytometry and a monoclonal antibody against the murine macrophage antigen, Mac-1, we found a significant increase in the number of marrow macrophages in aged mice. This was reflected as significant increase with age in the number of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase positive cells, as well as in colony forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M) progenitor cells. Macrophages from the marrow of old mice generated significantly less tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) than did macrophages from young mice, either spontaneously or when activated by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Furthermore, conditioned medium (CM) derived from either marrow or peritoneal macrophages of old mice caused less suppression of burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony growth than did CM obtained from young mice. Aging, therefore, is associated with an increase in the number of marrow macrophages that have an impaired ability to generate or release cytokines. The increase in macrophage number may reflect a compensation for their reduced function. Altered macrophage number and function may contribute to the age-related decline in hematopoietic reserve capacity.},

	abstract = {EGR1 is a member of the immediate early response transcription factor family and functions in cell growth, development, and stress responses in many tissues. Here we report an additional role for EGR1 in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

We have identified a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor that can differentiate into T, B and natural killer cells but not myeloid cells3. Here we report the prospective identification, purification and characterization, using cell-surface markers and flow cytometry, of a complementary clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages. Common myeloid progenitors give rise to either megakaryocyte/erythrocyte or granulocyte/macrophage progenitors. Purified progenitors were used to provide a first-pass expression profile of various haematopoiesis-related genes. We propose that the common lymphoid progenitor and common myeloid progenitor populations reflect the earliest branch points between the lymphoid and myeloid lineages, and that the commitment of common myeloid progenitors to either the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte or the granulocyte/macrophage lineages are mutually exclusive events.},

	abstract = {After the success of the new generation of immune therapies, immune checkpoint receptors have become one important center of attention of molecular oncologists. The initial success and hopes of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) therapies have shown some limitations since a majority of patients have continued to show resistance. Other immune checkpoints have raised some interest and are under investigation, such as T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif) domain (TIGIT), inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3), which appear as promising targets for immunotherapy. To explore their role and study possible synergetic effects of these different checkpoints, we have built a model of T cell receptor (TCR) regulation including not only PD1 and CTLA4, but also other well studied checkpoints (TIGIT, TIM3, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), cluster of differentiation 226 (CD226), ICOS, and tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs)) and simulated different aspects of T cell biology. Our model shows good correspondence with observations from available experimental studies of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 therapies and suggest efficient combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Among the possible candidates, TIGIT appears to be the most promising drug target in our model. The model predicts that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT4-dependent pathways, activated by cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL12) and interferon gamma (IFNG), could improve the effect of ICI therapy via upregulation of Tbet, suggesting that the effect of the cytokines related to STAT3/STAT1 activity is dependent on the balance between STAT1 and STAT3 downstream signalling.},

Alternative costimulatory receptors have been proposed, including members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, such as TLR5 and TLR2. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying a potential costimulatory role for TLR5, we generated detailed molecular maps and logical models for the TCR and TLR5 signaling pathways and a merged model for cross-interactions between the two pathways. Furthermore, we validated the resulting model by analyzing how T cells responded to the activation of these pathways alone or in combination, in terms of the activation of the transcriptional regulators CREB, AP-1 (c-Jun), and NF-κB (p65). Our merged model accurately predicted the experimental results, showing that the activation of TLR5 can play a similar role to that of CD28 activation with respect to AP-1, CREB, and NF-κB activation, thereby providing insights regarding the cross-regulation of these pathways in CD4$^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Alternative cell differentiation pathways are believed to arise from the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, the prediction of mammalian cell differentiation from the knowledge of the presence of specific signals and transcriptional factors is still a daunting challenge. In this respect, the vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its many branching differentiation pathways and cell types, is a compelling case study. In this paper, we propose an integrated, comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. As most available data are qualitative, we rely on a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses. To cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, we use an original model reduction approach together with a stable state identification algorithm. To assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation, we have performed a systematic series of simulations considering various prototypic environments. Consequently, we have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, but these were found to coexist with other transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. In the process, our logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. Finally, our logical model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.},

	abstract = {Boolean approaches and extensions thereof are becoming increasingly popular to model signaling and regulatory networks, including those controlling cell differentiation, pattern formation and embryonic development. Here, we describe a logical modeling framework relying on three steps: the delineation of a regulatory graph, the specification of multilevel components, and the encoding of Boolean rules specifying the behavior of model components depending on the levels or activities of their regulators. Referring to a non-deterministic, asynchronous updating scheme, we present several complementary methods and tools enabling the computation of stable activity patterns, the verification of the reachability of such patterns, as well as the generation of mean temporal evolution curves and the computation of the probabilities to reach distinct activity patterns. We apply this logical framework to the regulatory network controlling T lymphocyte specification. This process involves cross-regulations between specific T cell regulatory factors and factors driving alternative differentiation pathways, which remain accessible during the early steps of thymocyte development. Many transcription factors needed for T cell specification are required in other hematopoietic differentiation pathways and are combined in a fine-tuned, time-dependent fashion to achieve T cell commitment. Using the software GINsim, we integrated current knowledge into a dynamical model, which recapitulates the main developmental steps from early progenitors entering the thymus up to T cell commitment, as well as the impact of various documented environmental and genetic perturbations. Our model analysis further enabled the identification of several knowledge gaps. The model, software and whole analysis workflow are provided in computer-readable and executable form to ensure reproducibility and ease extensions.},

This developmental process is controlled by a complex regulatory network involving cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors, and chromatin remodelers. Using public data and data from our own molecular genetic experiments (quantitative PCR, Western blot, EMSA) or genome-wide assays (RNA-sequencing, ChIP-sequencing), we have assembled a comprehensive regulatory network encompassing the main transcription factors and signaling components involved in myeloid and lymphoid development. Focusing on B-cell and macrophage development, we defined a qualitative dynamical model recapitulating cytokine-induced differentiation of common progenitors, the effect of various reported gene knockdowns, and the reprogramming of pre-B cells into macrophages induced by the ectopic expression of specific transcription factors. The resulting network model can be used as a template for the integration of new hematopoietic differentiation and transdifferentiation data to foster our understanding of lymphoid/myeloid cell-fate decisions.},

	abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) are the major specialized antigen-presenting cells, thereby connecting innate and adaptive immunity. Because of their role in establishing adaptive immunity, they constitute promising targets for immunotherapy. Monocytes can differentiate into DCs in vitro in the presence of colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) and interleukin 4 (IL4), activating four signalling pathways (MAPK, JAK/STAT, NFKB and PI3K). However, the downstream transcriptional programme responsible for DC differentiation from monocytes (moDCs) remains unknown. By analysing the scientific literature on moDC differentiation, we established a preliminary logical model that helped us identify missing information regarding the activation of genes responsible for this differentiation, including missing targets for key transcription factors (TFs). Using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from the Blueprint consortium, we defined active and inactive promoters, together with differentially expressed genes in monocytes, moDCs and macrophages, which correspond to an alternative cell fate. We then used this functional genomic information to predict novel targets for previously identified TFs. By integrating this information, we refined our model and recapitulated the main established facts regarding moDC differentiation. Prospectively, the resulting model should be useful to develop novel immunotherapies targeting moDCs.},

The accessibility and reproducibility of such workflows is challenging, as publications often overlook analysis details, and because some of these tools may be difficult to install, and/or have a steep learning curve. The CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a unified environment to edit, execute, share, and reproduce analyses of qualitative models of biological networks. This framework combines the power of different technologies to ensure repeatability and to reduce users' learning curve of these technologies. The framework is distributed as a Docker image with the tools ready to be run without any installation step besides Docker, and is available on Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. The embedded computational workflows are edited with a Jupyter web interface, enabling the inclusion of textual annotations, along with the explicit code to execute, as well as the visualisation of the results. The resulting notebook files can then be shared and re-executed in the same environment. To date, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides access to software tools including GINsim, BioLQM, Pint, MaBoSS, and Cell Collective for the modelling and analysis of Boolean and multi-valued networks. More tools will be included in the future. We developed a Python interface for each of these tools to offer a seamless integration in the Jupyter web interface and ease the chaining of complementary analyses.},

In a tumour setting, macrophages encompass a spectrum between a tumour-suppressive (M1) or tumour-promoting (M2) state. The biology of macrophages found in tumours (Tumour Associated Macrophages) remains unclear, but understanding their impact on tumour progression is highly important. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of a macrophage polarization network, following two lines of enquiry: (i) we reconstruct the macrophage polarization network based on literature, extending it to include important stimuli in a tumour setting, and (ii) we build a dynamical model able to reproduce macrophage polarization in the presence of different stimuli, including the contact with cancer cells. Our simulations recapitulate the documented macrophage phenotypes and their dependencies on specific receptors and transcription factors, while also unravelling the formation of a special type of tumour associated macrophages in an in vitro model of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This model constitutes the first step towards elucidating the cross-talk between immune and cancer cells inside tumours, with the ultimate goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that could control the formation of tumour associated macrophages in patients.},

	abstract = {Boolean approaches and extensions thereof are becoming increasingly popular to model signaling and regulatory networks, including those controlling cell differentiation, pattern formation and embryonic development. Here, we describe a logical modeling framework relying on three steps: the delineation of a regulatory graph, the specification of multilevel components, and the encoding of Boolean rules specifying the behavior of model components depending on the levels or activities of their regulators. Referring to a non-deterministic, asynchronous updating scheme, we present several complementary methods and tools enabling the computation of stable activity patterns, the verification of the reachability of such patterns, as well as the generation of mean temporal evolution curves and the computation of the probabilities to reach distinct activity patterns. We apply this logical framework to the regulatory network controlling T lymphocyte specification. This process involves cross-regulations between specific T cell regulatory factors and factors driving alternative differentiation pathways, which remain accessible during the early steps of thymocyte development. Many transcription factors needed for T cell specification are required in other hematopoietic differentiation pathways and are combined in a fine-tuned, time-dependent fashion to achieve T cell commitment. Using the software GINsim, we integrated current knowledge into a dynamical model, which recapitulates the main developmental steps from early progenitors entering the thymus up to T cell commitment, as well as the impact of various documented environmental and genetic perturbations. Our model analysis further enabled the identification of several knowledge gaps.

	abstract = {Despite promising progress in targeted breast cancer therapy, drug resistance remains challenging. The monoclonal antibody drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab as well as the small molecule inhibitor erlotinib were designed to prevent ErbB-2 and ErbB-1 receptor induced deregulated protein signalling, contributing to tumour progression. The oncogenic potential of ErbB receptors unfolds in case of overexpression or mutations. Dimerisation with other receptors allows to bypass pathway blockades. Our intention is to reconstruct the ErbB network to reveal resistance mechanisms. We used longitudinal proteomic data of ErbB receptors and downstream targets in the ErbB-2 amplified breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954 treated with erlotinib, trastuzumab or pertuzumab, alone or combined, up to 60 minutes and 30 hours, respectively. In a Boolean modelling approach, signalling networks were reconstructed based on these data in a cell line and time course specific manner, including prior literature knowledge. Finally, we simulated network response to inhibitor combinations to detect signalling nodes reflecting growth inhibition. The networks pointed to cell line specific activation patterns of the MAPK and PI3K pathway. In BT474, the PI3K signal route was favoured, while in SKBR3, novel edges highlighted MAPK signalling. In HCC1954, the inferred edges stimulated both pathways. For example, we uncovered feedback loops amplifying PI3K signalling, in line with the known trastuzumab resistance of this cell line. In the perturbation simulations on the short-term networks, we analysed ERK1/2, AKT and p70S6K. The results indicated a pathway specific drug response, driven by the type of growth factor stimulus. HCC1954 revealed an edgetic type of PIK3CA-mutation, contributing to trastuzumab inefficacy. Drug impact on the AKT and ERK1/2 signalling axes is mirrored by effects on RB and RPS6, relating to phenotypic events like cell growth or proliferation. Therefore, we additionally analysed RB and RPS6 in the long-term networks. We derived protein interaction models for three breast cancer cell lines. Changes compared to the common reference network hint towards individual characteristics and potential drug resistance mechanisms. Simulation of perturbations were consistent with the experimental data, confirming our combined reverse and forward engineering approach as valuable for drug discovery and personalised medicine.},

	abstract = {Alternative cell differentiation pathways are believed to arise from the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, the prediction of mammalian cell differentiation from the knowledge of the presence of specific signals and transcriptional factors is still a daunting challenge. In this respect, the vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its many branching differentiation pathways and cell types, is a compelling case study. In this paper, we propose an integrated, comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. As most available data are qualitative, we rely on a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses. To cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, we use an original model reduction approach together with a stable state identification algorithm. To assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation, we have performed a systematic series of simulations considering various prototypic environments. Consequently, we have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, but these were found to coexist with other transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. In the process, our logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. Finally, our logical model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.},

Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

	abstract = {SummarySimple feedback loops behave in two essentially different ways depending on whether they contain an odd number of inhibitory elements (“negative” loops) or an even number of inhibitory elements (“positive” loops); for proper values of parameters or delays, the former generate sustained oscillations, the latter, multiple steady states. For more complex systems, as far as one can tell, the presence of at least one negative loop in the logical structure appears as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a permanent periodic behaviour, and the presence of at least one positive loop as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for multiple steady states.The second part of this paper deals with the cooperative use of Boolean and continuous methods in the field and with the relations between Boolean and quantitative iteration methods.},

With this environment, the needs for modeling signaling pathways are facilitated, including model construction, visualization, simulations of mutations, drug treatments and sensitivity analyses. It offers a framework for automated production of theoretical predictions.MaBoSS software can be found at https://maboss.curie.fr, including tutorials on existing models and examples of models.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The results suggest that, if each “gene” is directly affected by two or three other “genes”, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested.},

These new profiles represent an 18\% expansion compared to the previous release. JASPAR 2020 comes with a novel collection of unvalidated TF-binding profiles for which our curators did not find orthogonal supporting evidence in the literature. This collection has a dedicated web form to engage the community in the curation of unvalidated TF-binding profiles. Moreover, we created a Q\&amp;A forum to ease the communication between the user community and JASPAR curators. Finally, we updated the genomic tracks, inference tool, and TF-binding profile similarity clusters.

The STRING database aims to collect and integrate this information, by consolidating known and predicted protein–protein association data for a large number of organisms. The associations in STRING include direct (physical) interactions, as well as indirect (functional) interactions, as long as both are specific and biologically meaningful. Apart from collecting and reassessing available experimental data on protein–protein interactions, and importing known pathways and protein complexes from curated databases, interaction predictions are derived from the following sources: (i) systematic co-expression analysis, (ii) detection of shared selective signals across genomes, (iii) automated text-mining of the scientific literature and (iv) computational transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on gene orthology. In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework. Further improvements include automated background analysis of user inputs for functional enrichments, and streamlined download options.

Here, we present TRRUST v2 (www.grnpedia.org/trrust) with a significant improvement from the previous version, including a significantly increased size of the database consisting of 8444 regulatory interactions for 800 TFs in humans. More importantly, TRRUST v2 also contains a database for TF-target interactions in mice, including 6552 TF-target interactions for 828 mouse TFs. TRRUST v2 is also substantially more comprehensive and less biased than other TF-target interaction databases. We also improved the web interface, which now enables prioritization of key TFs for a physiological condition depicted by a set of user-input transcriptional responsive genes. With the significant expansion in the database size and inclusion of the new web tool for TF prioritization, we believe that TRRUST v2 will be a versatile database for the study of the transcriptional regulation involved in human diseases.},

From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/.},

	abstract = {Communication networks between cells and tissues are necessary for homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Intercellular (between cell) communication networks are particularly relevant in stem cell biology, as stem cell fate decisions (self-renewal, proliferation, lineage specification) are tightly regulated based on physiological demand. We have developed a novel mathematical model of blood stem cell development incorporating cell-level kinetic parameters as functions of secreted molecule-mediated intercellular networks. By relation to quantitative cellular assays, our model is capable of predictively simulating many disparate features of both normal and malignant hematopoiesis, relating internal parameters and microenvironmental variables to measurable cell fate outcomes. Through integrated in silico and experimental analyses, we show that blood stem and progenitor cell fate is regulated by cell?cell feedback, and can be controlled non-cell autonomously by dynamically perturbing intercellular signalling. We extend this concept by demonstrating that variability in the secretion rates of the intercellular regulators is sufficient to explain heterogeneity in culture outputs, and that loss of responsiveness to cell?cell feedback signalling is both necessary and sufficient to induce leukemic transformation in silico.},

Considered are three general models of a system involving the subpopulations of stem cells, precursor cells and mature cells, with different configurations of regulation feedbacks. The models correspond basically to the blood cell production process: however, other applications are possible. First, the simplified version (describable by ordinary differential equations) is considered. Fairly complete characterization of the trajectories is possible in this case, using the Lyapunov functions and phase plane techniques. Next, for the general models, the stability of equations linearized around the equilibria is investigated. Certain results can be obtained here, using both exact methods and numerical procedures based on an original lemma on the zeros of exponential polynomials. Then global properties (boundedness, attractivity. etc.) are examined for the nonlinear. delay case using a range of methods: Lyapunov functionals, Razumikhin functions and direct estimates on solutions. Certain special cases of our models reduce to previous literature models of blood production. Results of our analysis enable to exclude these configurations of regulation feedbacks which yield model behaviour not compatible with biological and medical observations. Techniques developed in this paper are applicable to a wide range of possible models of cell production systems.},

The behavior of such complex networks cannot be predicted by simple intuitive approaches but requires sophisticated models and computational simulations. The purpose of such models is to generate experimentally testable hypotheses and to find explanations for unexpected experimental results.

The validity of mathematical modeling in hematopoiesis was established early by the pioneering work of Till and McCulloch. In reviewing more recent papers, we highlight deterministic, stochastic, statistical, and network-based models that have been used to better understand a range of topics in hematopoiesis, including blood cell production, the periodicity of cyclical neutropenia, stem cell production in response to cytokine administration, and the emergence of imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia. Future advances require technologic improvements in computing power, imaging, and proteomics as well as greater collaboration between experimentalists and modelers.

Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free. These findings highlight the structural diversity of real-world networks and the need for new theoretical explanations of these non-scale-free patterns.},

The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.},

Erythropoietin interacts with high-affinity cell surface receptors (EpoR) present on developing progenitors and is required for their survival. Previously we characterized the gene for EpoR and demonstrated that its promoter acts in a cell-specific manner. Here we show that the hematopoietic-specific transcription factor GATA-1 is necessary, and indeed is sufficient as the sole cell-restricted regulator, for activation of the EpoR promoter in fibroblast transfection assays. Hence, GATA-1, which participates in transcriptional control of the majority of erythroid-expressed genes, also acts on the promoter of an essential lineage-restricted receptor (EpoR). This central contribution of GATA-1 to EpoR promoter function provides a mechanism whereby a cell-restricted regulator may ensure the viability and subsequent maturation of progenitor cells during hematopoietic differentiation.},

In this paper, we present a Boolean network model that recapitulates HSC regulation in virtue of external signals coming from the niche. This Boolean network integrates and summarizes the current knowledge of HSC regulation and is based on extensive literature research. Furthermore, dynamic simulations suggest a novel systemic regulation of TP53 in homeostasis. Thereby, our model indicates that TP53 activity is balanced depending on external stimulations, engaging a regulatory mechanism involving ROS regulators and RAS activated transcription factors.

	abstract = {Abstract During differentiation and reprogramming, new cell identities are generated by reconfiguration of gene regulatory networks. Here, we combined automated formal reasoning with experimentation to expose the logic of network activation during induction of naïve pluripotency. We find that a Boolean network architecture defined for maintenance of naïve state embryonic stem cells (ESC) also explains transcription factor behaviour and potency during resetting from primed pluripotency. Computationally identified gene activation trajectories were experimentally substantiated at single-cell resolution by RT?qPCR. Contingency of factor availability explains the counterintuitive observation that Klf2, which is dispensable for ESC maintenance, is required during resetting. We tested 124 predictions formulated by the dynamic network, finding a predictive accuracy of 77.4\%. Finally, we show that this network explains and predicts experimental observations of somatic cell reprogramming. We conclude that a common deterministic program of gene regulation is sufficient to govern maintenance and induction of naïve pluripotency. The tools exemplified here could be broadly applied to delineate dynamic networks underlying cell fate transitions.},

	abstract = {Lineage fate decisions of hematopoietic cells depend on intrinsic factors and extrinsic signals provided by the bone marrow microenvironment, where they reside. Abnormalities in composition and function of hematopoietic niches have been proposed as key contributors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) progression. Our previous experimental findings strongly suggest that pro-inflammatory cues contribute to mesenchymal niche abnormalities that result in maintenance of ALL precursor cells at the expense of normal hematopoiesis. Here, we propose a molecular regulatory network interconnecting the major communication pathways between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within the bone marrow. Dynamical analysis of the network as a Boolean model reveals two stationary states that can be interpreted as the intercellular contact status. Furthermore, simulations describe the molecular patterns observed during experimental proliferation and activation. Importantly, our model predicts instability in the CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1 interactions following microenvironmental perturbation due by temporal signaling from Toll like receptors (TLRs) ligation. Therefore, aberrant expression of NF-κB induced by intrinsic or extrinsic factors may contribute to create a tumor microenvironment where a negative feedback loop inhibiting CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1 cellular communication axes allows for the maintenance of malignant cells.},

However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

However, use of this technology has been limited by reliance on indirect indexing of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here we present direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed sgRNAs are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq enables detection of multiple distinct sgRNA sequences from individual cells and thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol biogenesis and DNA repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also show that targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves efficacy of CRISPR interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly active CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Last, we show that hybridization-based target enrichment permits sensitive, specific sequencing of informative transcripts from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.},

Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease.},

We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells.

Our analyses suggest significant variation in cell-type composition and gene expression among donors, including biological processes affected by donor age.

Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively.

We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance.

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined3-11. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity12-17. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.},

Here we integrated flow cytometric, transcriptomic and functional data at single-cell resolution to quantitatively map early differentiation of human HSCs towards lineage commitment. During homeostasis, individual HSCs gradually acquire lineage biases along multiple directions without passing through discrete hierarchically organized progenitor populations. Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a 'continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' (CLOUD-HSPCs). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis.

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency.

Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.},

Impaired lymphoid differentiation potential of aged LMPP/MPP4 is not rescued by transplantation into a young bone marrow microenvironment, demonstrating cell-autonomous changes in the MPP compartment with aging. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.},

However, with age, the balance is disrupted, and LT-HSCs produce a myeloid-biased output, resulting in poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is prevalent among aged LT-HSCs. We identify CD61 as a marker of mLT-HSCs and show that CD61-high LT-HSCs are uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict that several transcription factors regulate the mLT-HSCs gene program and show that Klf5, Ikzf1, and Stat3 play an important role in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. We have therefore identified and isolated an LT-HSC subset that regulates myeloid versus lymphoid balance under inflammatory challenge and with age.},

Thereafter, scRNA-seq was performed to distinguish transcriptional effects induced by gemcitabine/carboplatin. Gene expression was calculated and evaluated among cells within and between samples compared to untreated cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that the treatments effectively decrease cell proliferation, indicated by the proportion of cells in the G2M-phase dropping from 35\% in untreated cells to 14.3\% in treated cells. Clustering and t-SNE showed that cells within samples and between treated and untreated samples were affected differently. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the treatments influence KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies related to myeloid cell proliferation/differentiation, immune response, cancer, and the cell cycle. The present study shows the feasibility of using scRNA-seq and chemotherapy-treated HSPCs to find genes, pathways, and biological processes affected among and between treated and untreated cells.

	abstract = {Haematopoiesis, the process of mature blood and immune cell production, is functionally organized as a hierarchy, with self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells sitting at the very top. Multiple models have been proposed as to what the earliest lineage choices are in these primitive haematopoietic compartments, the cellular intermediates, and the resulting lineage trees that emerge from them. Given that the bulk of studies addressing lineage outcomes have been performed in the context of haematopoietic transplantation, current models of lineage branching are more likely to represent roadmaps of lineage potential than native fate. Here we use transposon tagging to clonally trace the fates of progenitors and stem cells in unperturbed haematopoiesis. Our results describe a distinct clonal roadmap in which the megakaryocyte lineage arises largely independently of other haematopoietic fates. Our data, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, identify a functional hierarchy of unilineage- and oligolineage-producing clones within the multipotent progenitor population. Finally, our results demonstrate that traditionally defined long-term haematopoietic stem cells are a significant source of megakaryocyte-restricted progenitors, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage is the predominant native fate of long-term haematopoietic stem cells. Our study provides evidence for a substantially revised roadmap for unperturbed haematopoiesis, and highlights unique properties of multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic stem cells in situ.},

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

Here we used FateID to delineate domains of fate bias and enable the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, thereby revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays.

We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations.

In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a Gprc5c-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc. Mice maintained on a vitamin A-free diet lose HSCs and show a disrupted re-entry into dormancy after exposure to inflammatory stress stimuli.

	abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice. Our findings demonstrate crucial roles for Neurod2 in cortical development and function, whose alterations likely account for ASD and related symptoms in the newly defined NEUROD2 mutation syndrome.},

	abstract = {The functional potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) declines during aging, and in doing so, significantly contributes to hematopoietic pathophysiology in the elderly. To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

However, single cell transplantation assays revealed that the sustained expression of Bmi1 augmented the multi-lineage repopulating capacity of aged HSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of Bmi1 combined with an RNA sequence analysis showed that the majority of Bmi1 direct target genes are developmental regulator genes marked with a bivalent histone domain. The sustained expression of Bmi1 strictly maintained the transcriptional repression of their target genes and enforced expression of HSC signature genes in aged HSCs. Therefore, the manipulation of Bmi1 expression is a potential approach against impairments in HSC function with aging.},

	abstract = {Highly proliferative tissues such as the gut, skin, and bone marrow lose millions of cells each day to normal attrition and challenge from different biological adversities. To achieve a lifespan beyond the longevity of individual cell types, tissue-specific stem cells sustain these tissues throughout the life of a human. For example, the lifespan of erythrocytes is about 100 days and adults make about two million new erythrocytes every second. A small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow is responsible for the lifetime maintenance of these populations. However, there are changes that occur within the HSC pool during aging. Biologically, these changes manifest as blunted immune responses, decreased bone marrow cellularity, and increased risk of myeloid diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction of aging HSCs is an important focus of biomedical research. With advances in modern health care, the average age of the general population is ever increasing. If molecular or pharmacological interventions could be discovered that rejuvenate aging HSCs, it could reduce the burden of age related immune system compromise as well as open up new opportunities for treatment of hematological disorders with regenerative therapy.},

Regenerative stress revealed that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs had a lineage-skewing potential from lymphopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, an increase in the long-term-HSC pool, and a decreased repopulation potential. Furthermore, oldplzf-mutant HSCs present an amplified aging phenotype, suggesting that plzf controls age-related pathway. We found that Zbtb16(lu/lu)HSCs harbor a transcriptional signature associated with a loss of stemness and cell cycle deregulation. Lastly, cell cycle analyses revealed an important role for plzf in the regulation of the G1-S transition of HSCs.

Telomere shortening in response to mutation of the gene encoding telomerase is associated with impaired organ maintenance and shortened lifespan in humans6 and in mice7,8,9. The in vivo function of p21 in the context of telomere dysfunction is unknown. Here we show that deletion of p21 prolongs the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. p21 deletion improved hematolymphopoiesis and the maintenance of intestinal epithelia without rescuing telomere function. Moreover, deletion of p21 rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells from mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In these mice, apoptotic responses remained intact, and p21 deletion did not accelerate chromosomal instability or cancer formation. This study provides experimental evidence that telomere dysfunction induces p21-dependent checkpoints in vivo that can limit longevity at the organismal level.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging has become a concern in chemotherapy of older patients. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) control HSC activity during regenerative hematopoiesis. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a connexin constituent of gap junctions (GJs) is expressed in HSCs, down-regulated during differentiation, and postulated to be a self-renewal gene. Our studies, however, reveal that hematopoietic-specific Cx43 deficiency does not result in significant long-term competitive repopulation deficiency. Instead, hematopoietic Cx43 (H-Cx43) deficiency delays hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU-treated H-Cx43-deficient HSC and progenitors (HSC/P) cells display decreased survival and fail to enter the cell cycle to proliferate. Cell cycle quiescence is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(cip1.) and p16(INK4a), and Forkhead transcriptional factor 1 (Foxo1), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating that H-Cx43-deficient HSCs are prone to senescence. The mechanism of increased senescence in H-Cx43-deficient HSC/P cells depends on their inability to transfer reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the HM, leading to accumulation of ROS within HSCs. In vivo antioxidant administration prevents the defective hematopoietic regeneration, as well as exogenous expression of Cx43 in HSC/P cells. Furthermore, ROS transfer from HSC/P cells to BM stromal cells is also rescued by reexpression of Cx43 in HSC/P. Finally, the deficiency of Cx43 in the HM phenocopies the hematopoietic defect in vivo. These results indicate that Cx43 exerts a protective role and regulates the HSC/P ROS content through ROS transfer to the HM, resulting in HSC protection during stress hematopoietic regeneration.},

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments. These data show that inactivation of p38 MAPK protects HSCs against loss of self-renewal capacity.

Once HSCs exit dormancy and accrue divisions, they also progressively lose the ability to return to G0 and functional activities associated with quiescent HSCs. In addition, dormant HSPCs phenotypically defined as multipotent progenitor cells display robust stem cell activity upon transplantation, suggesting that temporal quiescence is a greater indicator of function than cell-surface phenotype. Our studies suggest that once homeostatic HSCs leave dormancy, they are slated for extinction. They self-renew phenotypically, but they lose self-renewal activity.

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew for life, thereby making them one of the few blood cells that truly age. Paradoxically, although HSCs numerically expand with age, their functional activity declines over time, resulting in degraded blood production and impaired engraftment following transplantation. While many drivers of HSC ageing have been proposed, the reason why HSC function degrades with age remains unknown. Here we show that cycling old HSCs in mice have heightened levels of replication stress associated with cell cycle defects and chromosome gaps or breaks, which are due to decreased expression of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase components and altered dynamics of DNA replication forks. Nonetheless, old HSCs survive replication unless confronted with a strong replication challenge, such as transplantation. Moreover, once old HSCs re-establish quiescence, residual replication stress on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes leads to the formation of nucleolar-associated γH2AX signals, which persist owing to ineffective H2AX dephosphorylation by mislocalized PP4c phosphatase rather than ongoing DNA damage. Persistent nucleolar γH2AX also acts as a histone modification marking the transcriptional silencing of rDNA genes and decreased ribosome biogenesis in quiescent old HSCs. Our results identify replication stress as a potent driver of functional decline in old HSCs, and highlight the MCM DNA helicase as a potential molecular target for rejuvenation therapies.},

However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors.

Telomeres also shorten during replicative aging in vivo in hematopoietic cells, including early hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from humans and mice, despite readily detectable levels of telomerase in these cells. To assess the relevance of telomerase to the long-term replicative capacity of HSCs in vivo, we serially transplanted HSCs from wild-type and telomerase-deficient mice until exhaustion and monitored telomere length in HSCs during this process. Telomerase-deficient HSCs could be serially transplanted for only 2 rounds, whereas wild-type HSCs could be serially transplanted for at least 4 rounds. Furthermore, the rate of telomere shortening was increased approximately 2-fold during serial transplantation of telomerase-deficient HSCs. These findings suggest that one role for telomerase in the HSC is to partially counter the rate of telomere shortening during division of HSCs, thereby preventing premature loss of telomere function and providing added replicative capacity.},

	abstract = {The replicative lifespan of normal somatic cells is restricted by the erosion of telomeres, which are protective caps at the ends of linear chromosomes. The loss of telomeres induces antiproliferative signals that eventually lead to cellular senescence. The enzyme complex telomerase can maintain telomeres, but its expression is confined to highly proliferative cells such as stem cells and tumor cells. The immense regenerative capacity of the hematopoietic system is provided by a distinct type of adult stem cell: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although blood cells have to be produced continuously throughout life, the HSC pool seems not to be spared by aging processes. Indeed, limited expression of telomerase is not sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in these cells, which is thought ultimately to limit their proliferative capacity. In this review, we discuss the relevance of telomere maintenance for the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and consider potential functions of telomerase in this context. We also present possible clinical applications of telomere manipulation in HSCs and new insights affecting the aging of the hematopoietic stem cell pool and replicative exhaustion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority of foci. The highest inter-individual variations for non-telomeric DNA damage were observed in middle-aged donors, whereas the individual DSB repair capacity appears to determine the extent of DNA damage accrual. However, analyzing different stem/progenitor subpopulations obtained from healthy elderly ({\textgreater}70 years), we observed an only modest increase in DNA damage accrual, most pronounced in the primitive CD34+CD38(-)-enriched subfraction, but sustained DNA repair efficiencies, suggesting that healthy lifestyle may slow down the natural aging process.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings we conclude that age-related non-telomeric DNA damage accrual accompanies physiological stem cell aging in humans. Moreover, aging may alter the functional capacity of human stem cells to repair DSBs, thereby deteriorating an important genome protection mechanism leading to exceeding DNA damage accumulation. However, the great inter-individual variations in middle-aged individuals suggest that additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms and/or extrinsic factors contribute to the age-associated DNA damage accumulation.},

While the mechanisms driving stem cell aging are poorly understood, mounting evidence points to age-dependent DNA damage accrual as an important contributing factor. While it has been postulated that DNA damage may deplete stem cell numbers with age, recent studies indicate that murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves are in fact maintained despite the accrual of genomic damage with age. Evidence suggests this to be a result of the quiescent (G0) cell cycle status of HSC, which results in an attenuation of checkpoint control and DNA damage responses for repair or apoptosis. When aged stem cells that have acquired damage are called into cycle under conditions of stress or tissue regeneration however, their functional capacity was shown to be severely impaired. These data suggest that age-dependent DNA damage accumulation may underlie the diminished capacity of aged stem cells to mediate a return to homeostasis after acute stress or injury. Moreover, the cytoprotection afforded by stem cell quiescence in stress-free, steady-state conditions suggests a mechanism through which potentially dangerous lesions can accumulate in the stem cell pool with age.},

Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs.

Understanding the signaling pathways that govern hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to uncover their regulation and how this is skewed in hematological malignancies. Whether Notch is necessary for the regulation of mammalian HSPCs is still unclear. We therefore critically review the current literature on the role of Notch in HSPCs.

Recent Findings
HSPCs have shown different requirements for Notch signals in vitro and in vivo and at different stages of differentiation. Additionally, bone marrow niche cells activate Notch signaling in HSPCs enhancing their regenerative and self-renewal capacity.

Summary
Despite the controversy, adequate levels of Notch signaling appear necessary to avoid the development of hematological malignancies. Contrary to early studies, recent research suggests that Notch signaling may play a role in homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis but further investigation is necessary to understand how it is regulated by the different ligand/receptor pairings and the molecular mechanisms that are triggered.},

Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.,

HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence.

We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where \textit{Tie2}-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes.

ACD is a purported mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, but definitive evidence for this cellular process remains open to conjecture. To address this issue, we chose 73 candidate genes that function within the cell polarity network to identify potential determinants that may concomitantly alter HSC fate while also exhibiting asymmetric segregation at cell division. Initial gene-expression profiles of polarity candidates showed high and differential expression in both HSCs and leukemia stem cells. Altered HSC fate was assessed by our established in vitro to in vivo screen on a subcohort of candidate polarity genes, which revealed 6 novel positive regulators of HSC function: Ap2a2, Gpsm2, Tmod1, Kif3a, Racgap1, and Ccnb1. Interestingly, live-cell videomicroscopy of the endocytic protein AP2A2 shows instances of asymmetric segregation during HSC/progenitor cell cytokinesis. These results contribute further evidence that ACD is functional in HSC self-renewal, suggest a role for Ap2a2 in HSC activity, and provide a unique opportunity to prospectively analyze progeny from HSC asymmetric divisions.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognised that alterations in cell shape and polarity play important roles in coordinating lymphocyte functions. In the last decade a new aspect of lymphocyte polarity, termed Asymmetric Cell Division (ACD), has attracted much attention. ACD has previously been shown to dictate or influence many aspects of development in model organisms such as the worm and the fly, and to be disrupted in disease. Recent observations that ACD also occurs in lymphocytes led to exciting speculations that ACD might influence lymphocyte differentiation and function, and leukaemia. However, dissecting the role that ACD might play in these activities is not straightforward, and the evidence to date for a functional role in lymphocyte fate determination has been controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence to date for ACD in lymphocytes, and how it might influence lymphocyte fate. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and suggest approaches to definitively test the physiological role of ACD in lymphocytes.},

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells self-renew and differentiate into all blood lineages throughout life, and can repair damaged blood systems upon transplantation. Asymmetric cell division has previously been suspected to be a regulator of haematopoietic-stem-cell fate, but its existence has not directly been shown1. In asymmetric cell division, asymmetric fates of future daughter cells are prospectively determined by a mechanism that is linked to mitosis. This can be mediated by asymmetric inheritance of cell-extrinsic niche signals by, for example, orienting the divisional plane, or by the asymmetric inheritance of cell-intrinsic fate determinants. Observations of asymmetric inheritance or of asymmetric daughter-cell fates alone are not sufficient to demonstrate asymmetric cell division2. In both cases, sister-cell fates could be controlled by mechanisms that are independent of division. Here we demonstrate that the cellular degradative machinery—including lysosomes, autophagosomes, mitophagosomes and the protein NUMB—can be asymmetrically inherited into haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells. This asymmetric inheritance predicts the asymmetric future metabolic and translational activation and fates of haematopoietic-stem-cell daughter cells and their offspring. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for the existence of asymmetric cell division in haematopoietic stem cells.},

The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.},

The relative asymmetry between self-renewal and differentiation in balance with apoptosis determines the size and durability of a stem-cell pool. Regulation of the cell cycle is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying determination of cell fate. Absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1), a late G1-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), has previously been shown to enable cell-cycle entry of haematopoietic stem cells, but leads to premature exhaustion of the stem cells under conditions of stress. We show here that deletion of an early G1-phase CKI, p18(INK4C), results in strikingly improved long-term engraftment, largely by increasing self-renewing divisions of the primitive cells in murine transplant models. Therefore, different CKIs have highly distinct effects on the kinetics of stem cells, possibly because of their active position in the cell cycle, and p18(INK4C) appears to be a strong inhibitor limiting the potential of stem-cell self-renewal in vivo.},

As a consequence, HSCs may undergo "exhaustion" in serial transplant recipients, for which the cellular and molecular bases are not well understood. Hematopoietic exhaustion appears to be accelerated in the absence of p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) in irradiated hosts. Our recent study demonstrated that unlike loss of p21, deletion of p18(INK4C) (p18), a distinct CKI, results in improved long-term engraftment, largely because of increased self-renewing divisions of HSCs in vivo. We show here that HSCs deficient in p18 sustained their competitiveness to wild-type HSCs from unmanipulated young mice, and retained multilineage differentiation potential after multiple rounds of serial bone marrow transfer over a period of more than 3 years. Further, p18 absence significantly decelerated hematopoietic exhaustion caused by p21 deficiency. Such an effect was shown to occur at the stem cell level, likely by a counteracting mechanism against the cellular senescence outcome. Our current study provides new insights into the distinct impacts of these cell-cycle regulators on HSC exhaustion and possibly HSC aging as well under proliferative stress, thereby offering potential pharmacologic targets for sustaining the durability of stressed HSCs in transplantation or elderly patients.},

Members of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (p21, p27, p57) have been implicated in HSC quiescence, but loss of p21 or p27 in mice affects HSC quiescence or functionality only under conditions of stress. Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus. Our results therefore suggest that, among Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitors, p57 plays a predominant role in the quiescence and maintenance of adult HSCs.},

Sustained activation of these protein kinases provides cancer cells with the power to enter the cell cycle continuously by triggering G1-S-phase transitions and dramatically shortening the duration of the G1 phase. It has also become clear, however, that CDK4/6 effectively counter cancer cell-intrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms, senescence and apoptosis, which must be overcome during cell transformation and kept at bay throughout all stages of tumorigenesis. As a central 'node' in cellular signaling networks, cyclin D-dependent kinases sense a plethora of mitogenic signals to orchestrate specific transcriptional programs.

However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required. In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human HSCs replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks). We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data. Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human HSCs increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent HSCs in humans significantly differs from mouse. In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with aplastic anemia, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of HSCs.},

Derepression of the Ink4a/Arf gene locus has been largely attributed to Bmi1-deficient phenotypes in the nervous system. However, its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal remained undetermined. In this study, we show that derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice were tightly associated with a loss of self-renewing HSCs. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes substantially restored the self-renewal capacity of Bmi1−/− HSCs. Thus, Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical failsafe against the p16Ink4a- and p19Arf-dependent premature loss of HSCs. We further identified a novel role for Bmi1 in the organization of a functional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The BM microenvironment in Bmi1−/− mice appeared severely defective in supporting hematopoiesis. The deletion of both Ink4a and Arf genes did not considerably restore the impaired BM microenvironment, leading to a sustained postnatal HSC depletion in Bmi1−/−Ink4a-Arf−/− mice. Our findings unveil a differential role of derepressed Ink4a and Arf on HSCs and their BM microenvironment in Bmi1-deficient mice.

	abstract = {Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial to maintain lifelong production of all blood cells. Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

	abstract = {The regulation of HSC proliferation and engraftment of the BM is an important but poorly understood process, particularly during ontogeny. Here we show that in mice, all HSCs are cycling until 3 weeks after birth. Then, within 1 week, most became quiescent. Prior to 4 weeks of age, the proliferating HSCs with long-term multilineage repopulating activity displayed an engraftment defect when transiting S/G2/M. During these cell cycle phases, their expression of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; also referred to as stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) transiently increased. The defective engrafting activity of HSCs in S/G2/M was reversed when cells were allowed to progress into G1 prior to injection or when the hosts (but not the cells) were pretreated with a CXCL12 antagonist. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of CXCL12 antagonist pretreatment was exclusive to transplants of long-term multilineage repopulating HSCs in S/G2/M. These results demonstrate what we believe to be a new HSC regulatory checkpoint during development. They also suggest an ability of HSCs to express CXCL12 in a fashion that changes with cell cycle progression and is associated with a defective engraftment that can be overcome by in vivo administration of a CXCL12 antagonist.},

Because HSCs must persist for a lifetime, the balance between their proliferation and quiescence is carefully regulated to ensure blood homeostasis while limiting cellular damage. Cell cycle regulation therefore plays a critical role in controlling HSC function during both fetal life and in the adult. The cell cycle activity of HSCs is carefully modulated by a complex interplay between cell-intrinsic mechanisms and cell-extrinsic factors produced by the microenvironment. This fine-tuned regulatory network may become altered with age, leading to aberrant HSC cell cycle regulation, degraded HSC function, and hematological malignancy.},

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival.

Cells in the Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3− HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression.

We found that the amount of protein synthesized per hour in HSCs in vivo was lower than in most other haematopoietic cells, even if we controlled for differences in cell cycle status or forced HSCs to undergo self-renewing divisions. Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24Bst/+ mice further reduced protein synthesis in HSCs and impaired HSC function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in HSCs but also reduced HSC function. Rpl24Bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in HSCs; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring HSC function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes HSCs and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs HSC function.},

We also show that the normally rare myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic system.

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) persist throughout life by undergoing extensive self-renewal divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state. The mechanisms that support HSC self-renewal change throughout the course of development as temporal changes in transcriptional regulators coordinate distinct genetic programs in fetal, post-natal and adult HSCs. These self-renewal programs are often ectopically activated in leukemia cells to drive neoplastic proliferation and high expression of HSC-associated genes predicts a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this regard, it was recently shown that expression of the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 (Bcl2 associated transcription factor 1) is increased in AML blasts relative to normal precursor populations and suppression of BCLAF1 causes reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation to a dendritic cell fate. These findings raise the question of whether BCLAF1 may regulate normal as well as neoplastic self-renewal programs.We find that Bclaf1 is highly expressed in HSCs versus committed bone marrow populations consistent with a potential role for this gene in HSC functions. To test whether BCLAF1 regulates HSC development and hematopoiesis, we used germline loss of function mice. Bclaf1-/- mice succumb to pulmonary failure shortly after birth due to poor lung development, so we assessed prenatal hematopoiesis. Bclaf1-deficient mice had significantly reduced HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) frequencies and numbers despite normal fetal liver cellularity. To determine if Bclaf1 is required for HSC function during fetal development, we performed competitive reconstitution assays. Fetal liver cells from Bclaf1+/+or Bclaf1-/-mice were transplanted along with wild-type competitor bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Compared to recipients of Bclaf1+/+fetal liver cells, recipients of Bclaf1-/-cells had a significantly lower percentage of donor-derived leukocytes at all time points after transplantation as well as reduced percentage of donor HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplant. Notably, all leukocyte populations (B cells, T cells, granulocytes and macrophages) from Bclaf1-/-donors were reduced consistent with an abnormality in HSC repopulating activity rather than a defect in a specific differentiation pathway. Consistent with these findings, Bclaf-deficient cells did not engraft in competitive transplants with limiting numbers of sorted fetal liver HSCs whereas sorted wild-type Bclaf1+/+cells effectively reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient mice. In addition, Vav-cre:Bclaf1flox/floxmice, which have selective deletion of Bclaf1 in hematopoietic cells, have reduced frequencies and numbers of fetal liver HSCs identical to the findings observed in germline Bclaf1-/-mice. These results show that loss of Bclaf1 leads to defective development and repopulating activity of fetal HSCs.Interestingly, when adult mice are successfully engrafted with Bclaf1-deficient HSCs, the donor HSCs suffer no additional functional impairment. Furthermore, in secondary transplant experiments Bclaf1-deficient HSCs maintain long-term repopulating activity. Thus, Bclaf1 may have distinct functions in fetal versus adult HSC self-renewal. Collectively, our findings reveal Bclaf1 is a novel regulator of fetal HSC function and suggest that it may have distinct functions in different developmental contexts.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

By a poorly understood mechanism, stem cells are maintained through self-renewal while concomitantly producing differentiated progeny. Here, we provide genetic evidence for an unexpected function of the c-Myc protein in the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs.

This study reports a role for the transcription factor FOG-1 in specification of preMegEs, while GATA-1 is subsequently required for erythroid-lineage commitment., The transcription factors that control lineage specification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been well described for the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, whereas transcriptional control of erythroid (E) and megakaryocytic (Mk) fate is less understood. We here use conditional removal of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 transcription factors to identify FOG-1 as required for the formation of all committed Mk- and E-lineage progenitors, whereas GATA-1 was observed to be specifically required for E-lineage commitment. FOG-1-deficient HSCs and preMegEs, the latter normally bipotent for the Mk and E lineages, underwent myeloid transcriptional reprogramming, and formed myeloid, but not erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in vitro. These results identify FOG-1 and GATA-1 as required for formation of bipotent Mk/E progenitors and their E-lineage commitment, respectively, and show that FOG-1 mediates transcriptional Mk/E programming of HSCs as well as their subsequent Mk/E-lineage commitment. Finally, C/EBPs and FOG-1 exhibited transcriptional cross-regulation in early myelo-erythroid progenitors making their functional antagonism a potential mechanism for separation of the myeloid and Mk/E lineages.},

Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.},

The lethality of Gata1-null embryos has precluded determination of its role in adult erythropoiesis. Here we have examined the effects of Gata1 loss in adult erythropoiesis using conditional Gata1 knockout mice expressing either interferon- or tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Mx-Cre and Tx-Cre, respectively). Mx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination, although incomplete, resulted in maturation arrest of Gata1-null erythroid cells at the proerythroblast stage, thrombocytopenia, and excessive proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen. Tx-Cre–mediated Gata1 recombination resulted in depletion of the erythroid compartment in bone marrow and spleen. Formation of the early and late erythroid progenitors in bone marrow was significantly reduced in the absence of Gata1. Furthermore, on treatment with a hemolytic agent, these mice failed to activate a stress erythropoietic response, despite the rising erythropoietin levels. These results indicate that, in addition to the requirement of Gata1 in adult megakaryopoiesis, Gata1 is necessary for steady-state erythropoiesis and for erythroid expansion in response to anemia. Thus, ablation of Gata1 in adult mice results in a condition resembling aplastic crisis in human.},

Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis7,8. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages9,10,11, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression12,13.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors are master regulatory switches of differentiation, including the development of specific hematopoietic lineages from stem cells. Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.},

While Fli1 and GATA-1 synergistically regulate the expression of multiple megakaryocytic genes, the level of GATA-1 present on a subset of these promoters is reduced in vivo in the Fli1(ΔCTA)/Fli1(ΔCTA) mice, providing a possible mechanism for the impared transcription observed.

We previously observed that marrow lacking the Cebpa +37 kb enhancer is impaired in producing B cells upon competitive transplantation. Additionally, a Cebpa enhancer/promoter-hCD4 transgene is expressed in B/myeloid CFU. Extending these findings, pan-hematopoietic murine Cebpa enhancer deletion using Mx1-Cre leads to expanded CLP, fewer preproB cells, markedly reduced proB and preB cells, and reduced mature B cells, without affecting T cell numbers. In contrast, enhancer deletion at the proB stage using Mb1-Cre does not impair B cell maturation. Further evaluation of CLP reveals that the Cebpa transgene is expressed almost exclusively in Flt3+ multipotent CLP versus B cell-restricted Flt3- CLP. In vitro, hCD4+ preproB cells produce both B and myeloid cells, whereas hCD4- preproB cells only produce B cells. Additionally, a subset of hCD4- preproB cells express high levels of RAG1-GFP, as seen also in proB cells. Global gene expression analysis indicates that hCD4+ preproB cells express proliferative pathways, whereas B cell development and signal transduction pathways predominate in hCD4- preproB cells. Consistent with these changes, Cebpa enhancer-deleted preproB cells downmodulate cell cycle pathways while upregulating B cell signaling pathways.

Unexpectedly, using two independent computational approaches, we established that deregulated aging genes consist largely of membrane-associated transcripts, including many cell surface molecules previously not associated with HSC biology. We show that Selp, the most consistent deregulated gene, is not merely a marker for aged HSCs but is associated with HSC functional decline. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed increased heterogeneity of the aged HSC pool. We identify the presence of transcriptionally "young-like" HSCs in aged bone marrow.

Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC.

	abstract = {Using homologous recombination, both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were inactivated. These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells. However, the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated, with the exception of beta h1-globin, which continued to be expressed at a very low level. The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells. When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts, they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals, based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 (GPI-1) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes. In contrast, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals suggested that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6\% to 8\%. This indicated that the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals must be short-lived, apparently due to the imbalance of beta-versus alpha-globin chains, leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis, the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene, as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals.},

Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require "permissive" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The SCL/TAL-1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors before lineage commitment. Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.},

	abstract = {The TAL-1/SCL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor essential for primitive hematopoiesis and for adult erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Activated transcription of TAL-1 as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements is associated with a high proportion of human T cell acute leukemias, showing that appropriate control of TAL-1 is crucial for the formation and subsequent fate of hematopoietic cells. Hence, the knowledge of the mechanisms, which govern the pattern of TAL-1 expression in hematopoiesis, is of great interest. We previously described a silencer in the 3'-untranslated region of human TAL-1, the activity of which is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific 40 kDa nuclear protein to a new DNA recognition motif, named tal-RE. Here, we show that tal-RE-binding activity, high in immature human hematopoietic progenitors is down regulated upon erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. This expression profile helped us to identify that PU.1/Spi-1 binds to the tal-RE sequences in vitro and occupies the TAL-1 silencer in vivo. By expressing a mutant protein containing only the ETS domain of PU.1 in human erythroleukemic HEL cells, we demonstrated that PU.1 mediates the transcriptional repression activity of the silencer. We found that ectopic PU.1 is not able to induce silencing activity in PU.1-negative Jurkat T cells, indicating that PU.1 activity, although necessary, is not sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity to the TAL-1 silencer. Finally, we showed that the silencer is also active in TAL-1-negative myeloid HL60 cells that express PU.1 at high levels. In summary, our study shows that PU.1, in addition to its positive role in TAL-1 expression in early hematopoietic progenitors, may also act as a mediator of TAL-1 silencing in some hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {GATA-1 and PU.1 are essential hematopoietic transcription factors that control erythromegakaryocytic and myelolymphoid differentiation, respectively. These proteins antagonize each other through direct physical interaction to repress alternate lineage programs. We used immortalized Gata1(-) erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cells to study how PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is regulated by GATA-1 and GATA-2, a related factor that is normally expressed at earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Both GATA factors bind the PU.1/Sfpi1 gene at 2 highly conserved regions. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 binding is associated with an undifferentiated state, intermediate level PU.1/Sfpi1 expression, and low-level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes. Restoration of GATA-1 function induces erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, GATA-1 replaces GATA-2 at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus and PU.1/Sfpi1 expression is extinguished. In contrast, when GATA-1 is not present, shRNA knockdown of GATA-2 increases PU.1/Sfpi1 expression by 3-fold and reprograms the cells to become macrophages. Our findings indicate that GATA factors act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis, in part by exerting variable repressive effects at the PU.1/Sfpi1 locus.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis. Consistent with a requirement for C/EBPalpha induction of PU.1 during myeloid development, we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha induces monocytic development when expressed in PU.1(+/+), PU.1(+/-), or PU.1(+/kd) marrow myeloid progenitors but induces granulocyte lineage commitment in PU.1(kd/kd) cells lacking the PU.1 distal enhancer and does not induce either lineage in PU.1(-/-) cells.},

Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation.

We show here that mice lacking FOG die during mid-embryonic development with severe anemia. FOG-/- erythroid cells display a marked, but partial, blockage of maturation, reminiscent of GATA-1- erythroid precursors. In contrast to GATA-1 deficiency, however, megakaryocytes fail to develop in the absence of FOG. Although the FOG-/- erythroid phenotype supports the proposed role of FOG as a GATA-1 cofactor in vivo, the latter finding points to a pivotal, GATA-1-independent requirement for FOG in megakaryocyte development from the bipotential erythroid/megakaryocytic progenitor.

We show here that FLI-1 represses the transcriptional activity of the beta-globin gene promoter in MEL cells and interacts with two of its critical transactivators, GATA-1 and EKLF. Unexpectedly, FLI-1 enhances the stimulating activity of GATA-1 on a GATA-1-responsive promoter but represses that of EKLF on beta-globin and an EKLF-responsive artificial promoters. This repressive effect of FLI-1 requires the ETS DNA binding domain and its association with either the N- or C-terminal domain, which themselves interact with EKLF but not with GATA-1. Furthermore, the FLI-1 ETS domain alone behaves as an autonomous repression domain when linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Taken together, these data indicate that FLI-1 represses EKLF-dependent transcription due to the repression activity of its ETS domain and its indirect recruitment to erythroid promoters by protein-protein interaction with EKLF. Reciprocally, we also show that EKLF itself represses the FLI-1-dependent megakaryocytic GPIX gene promoter, thus further suggesting that functional cross-antagonism between FLI-1 and EKLF might be involved in the control of the erythrocytic versus megakaryocytic differentiation of bipotential progenitors.},

	abstract = {Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite {\textgreater}80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure.

In contrast, we demonstrate that PU.1, like GATA-2, is essential for the generation of mast cells. PU.1-/- hematopoietic progenitors can be propagated in IL-3 and differentiate into mast cells or macrophages upon restoration of PU.1 activity. Using these progenitors and a conditionally activatable PU.1 protein, we show that PU.1 can negatively regulate expression of the GATA-2 gene. In the absence of GATA-2, PU.1 promotes macrophage but not mast cell differentiation. Reexpression of GATA-2 in such progenitors enables the generation of mast cells. We propose a developmental model in which cooperative function or antagonistic crossregulation by PU.1 of GATA-2 promotes distinct myeloid cell fates.},

Both GATA-1 and GATA-2 are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner, their expression being strictly controlled during the development and differentiation of erythroid cells. Closer examination revealed a cross-regulatory mechanism by which GATA-1 can control the expression of GATA-2 and vice versa, possibly via essential GATA binding sites in their cis-acting elements.

	abstract = {The lineage-specific transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 can physically interact to inhibit each other's function, but the mechanism of repression of GATA-1 function by PU.1 has not been elucidated. Both the N terminus and the C terminus of PU.1 can physically interact with the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1. It is demonstrated that the PU.1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, is required for inhibiting GATA-1 function. Induced overexpression of PU.1 in K562 erythroleukemia cells blocks hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. In this system, PU.1 does not affect the expression of GATA-1 messenger RNA, protein, or nuclear localization. However, GATA-1 DNA binding decreases dramatically. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified proteins, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PU.1 can specifically block GATA-1 DNA binding. In addition, PU.1 had a similar effect in the G1ER cell line, in which the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line G1E has been transduced with a GATA-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene, which is directly dependent on induction of the GATA-1 fusion protein to effect erythroid maturation. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, overexpression of PU.1 blocked DNA binding of the GATA-1 fusion protein as well as GATA-1-mediated erythroid differentiation of these G1ER cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which function of a lineage-specific transcription factor is inhibited by another lineage-restricted factor through direct protein-protein interactions. These findings contribute to understanding how protein-protein interactions participate in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. (Blood. 2000;96:2641-2648)},

	abstract = {Fli-1 is a proto-oncogene which is rearranged in tumors induced by three different retroviruses, Cas-Br-E, F-MuLV, and 10A1. This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.},

	abstract = {The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals, Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1 and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.},

	abstract = {The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.},

Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.},

During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an "on" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.},

Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGFβ signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes, and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Together these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior.

	abstract = {Unremitting blood cell production throughout the lifetime of an organism is reliant on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A rare and relatively quiescent cell type harbored in adult bone marrow, HSCs are, on entry into cell cycle fated to self-renew, undergo apoptosis or differentiate to progenitors (HPCs) that eventually yield specific classes of blood cells. Disruption of these HSC cell fate decisions is considered to be fundamental to the development of leukemia. Much effort has therefore been placed on understanding the molecular pathways that regulate HSC cell fate decisions and how these processes are undermined during leukemia. Transcription factors have emerged as critical regulators in this respect. Here we review the participation of zinc finger transcription factor GATA-2 in regulating normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell functionality, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia.},

Inactivation of JunB in postnatal mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) resembling early human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.},

	abstract = {KLF6 (Krüppel-like factor 6) is a transcription factor and tumour suppressor with a growing range of biological activities and transcriptional targets. Among these, KLF6 suppresses growth through transactivation of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1). KLF6 can be alternatively spliced, generating lower-molecular-mass isoforms that antagonize the full-length WT (wild-type) protein and promote growth. A key target gene of full-length KLF6 is endoglin, which is induced in vascular injury. Endoglin, a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein and TGF-beta auxiliary receptor, has a pro-angiogenic role in endothelial cells and is also involved in malignant progression. The aim of the present work was to explore the effect of TGF-beta on KLF6 expression and splicing, and to define the contribution of TGF-beta on promoters regulated by co-operation between KLF6 and Sp1 (specificity protein 1). Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, our data demonstrate that KLF6 co-operates with Sp1 in transcriptionally regulating KLF6-responsive genes and that this co-operation is further enhanced by TGF-beta1 through at least two mechanisms. First, in specific cell types, TGF-beta1 may decrease KLF6 alternative splicing, resulting in a net increase in full-length, growth-suppressive KLF6 activity. Secondly, KLF6-Sp1 co-operation is further enhanced by the TGF-beta-Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway via the likely formation of a tripartite KLF6-Sp1-Smad3 complex in which KLF6 interacts indirectly with Smad3 through Sp1, which may serve as a bridging molecule to co-ordinate this interaction. These findings unveil a finely tuned network of interactions between KLF6, Sp1 and TGF-beta to regulate target genes.},

These results demonstrate that LT-HSC proliferation and differentiation are uncoupled from self-renewal and establish some of the mechanisms by which JunB normally limits the production of myeloid progenitors, hence preventing initiation of myeloid malignancies.},

HSCs normally express Egr1 at high levels, but dramatically downregulate its expression when induced to divide and migrate. Consistent with this finding, mice lacking Egr1 exhibit significant increases in steady-state levels of dividing HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), and a striking spontaneous mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. These data identify EGR1 as a transcriptional regulator of stem cell migration that normally functions to promote HSC quiescence and retention in the niche. The ability of this single factor to regulate both proliferation and mobilization of HSCs suggests that EGR1 commands a genetic program that coordinates stem cell division and migration to maintain appropriate HSC number and function.},

In this study, we found that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling was upregulated in HSCs from bone marrow of mice with MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because of excessive production of TGFβ1, especially from megakaryocytes, and overactivation of latent TGFβ1 protein. We also found that SMAD3, a signal transducer of TGFβ1, directly bound to Egr3 and upregulated its expression to arrest proliferation of HSCs.

	abstract = {We present the new ASP system clingo 4. Unlike its predecessors, being mere monolithic combinations of the grounder gringo with the solver clasp, the new clingo 4 series offers high-level constructs for realizing complex reasoning processes. Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach that enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks. Several dynamical interpretations of BNs have been proposed. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of certain behaviors observed in quantitative systems. We introduce an execution paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offers the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks., Boolean Networks are a well-established model of biological networks, but usual interpretations can preclude the prediction of behaviours observed in quantitative systems. The authors introduce Most Permissive Boolean Networks, which are shown not to miss any behaviour achievable by the corresponding quantitative model.},

	abstract = {Multiple bone marrow stromal cell types have been identified as hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-regulating niche cells. However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.},

Devising a single model from them can require arbitrary choices, which may lead to strong biases in subsequent predictions. We introduce here a methodology for a) synthesizing Boolean model ensembles satisfying a set of biologically relevant constraints and b) reasoning on the dynamics of the ensembles of models. The synthesis is performed using Answer-Set Programming, extending prior work to account for solution diversity and universal constraints on reachable fixed points, enabling an accurate specification of desired dynamics. The sampled models are then simulated and the results are aggregated through averaging or can be analyzed as a multi-dimensional distribution. We illustrate our approach on a previously published Boolean model of a molecular network regulating the cell fate decisions in cancer progression. It appears that the ensemble-based approach to Boolean modelling brings new insights on the variability of synergistic interacting mutations effect concerning propensity of a cancer cell to metastasize.},

The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.},

However, the developmental branching points between these two large cell compartments are still controversial, and little is known about how their diversification is induced. Here, we give an overview of determinants that play a role at lymphoid-myeloid junctures, in particular transcription factors and cytokine receptors. Experiments showing that myeloid lineages can be reversibly reprogrammed into one another by transcription factor network perturbations are used to highlight key principles of lineage commitment. We also discuss experiments showing that lymphoid-to-myeloid but not myeloid-to-lymphoid conversions can be induced by the enforced expression of a single transcription factor. We close by proposing that this asymmetry is related to a higher complexity of transcription factor networks in lymphoid cells compared with myeloid cells, and we suggest that this feature must be considered when searching for mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem cells become committed to lymphoid lineages.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon’s target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {\textless}2 h.},

The decrease of immune cell production during aging is one of the features of immunosenescence. The impact of redox dysregulation in BM aging is still poorly understood. Here we use TP53INP1-deficient (KO) mice endowed with chronic oxidative stress to assess the influence of aging-associated redox alterations in BM homeostasis. We show that TP53INP1 deletion has no impact on aging-related accumulation of HSCs. In contrast, the aging-related contraction of the lymphoid compartment is mitigated in TP53INP1 KO mice. B cells that accumulate in old KO BM are differentiating cells that can mature into functional B cells. Importantly, this phenotype results from B cell-intrinsic events associated with defective redox control. Finally, we show that oxidative stress in aged TP53INP1-deficient mice maintains STAT5 expression and activation in early B cells, driving high Pax5 expression, which provides a molecular mechanism for maintenance of B cell development upon aging.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapid technological innovation for the generation of single-cell genomics data presents new challenges and opportunities for bioinformatics analysis. One such area lies in the development of new ways to train gene regulatory networks. The use of single-cell expression profiling technique allows the profiling of the expression states of hundreds of cells, but these expression states are typically noisier due to the presence of technical artefacts such as drop-outs. While many algorithms exist to infer a gene regulatory network, very few of them are able to harness the extra expression states present in single-cell expression data without getting adversely affected by the substantial technical noise present.
Results: Here we introduce BTR, an algorithm for training asynchronous Boolean models with single-cell expression data using a novel Boolean state space scoring function. BTR is capable of refining existing Boolean models and reconstructing new Boolean models by improving the match between model prediction and expression data. We demonstrate that the Boolean scoring function performed favourably against the BIC scoring function for Bayesian networks. In addition, we show that BTR outperforms many other network inference algorithms in both bulk and single-cell synthetic expression data. Lastly, we introduce two case studies, in which we use BTR to improve published Boolean models in order to generate potentially new biological insights.
Conclusions: BTR provides a novel way to refine or reconstruct Boolean models using single-cell expression data. Boolean model is particularly useful for network reconstruction using single-cell data because it is more robust to the effect of drop-outs. In addition, BTR does not assume any relationship in the expression states among cells, it is useful for reconstructing a gene regulatory network with as few assumptions as possible. Given the simplicity of Boolean models and the rapid adoption of single-cell genomics by biologists, BTR has the potential to make an impact across many fields of biomedical research.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

	abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.},

	abstract = {The dynamical analysis of large biological regulatory networks requires the development of scalable methods for mathematical modeling. Following the approach initially introduced by Thomas, we formalize the interactions between the components of a network in terms of discrete variables, functions, and parameters. Model simulations result in directed graphs, called state transition graphs. We are particularly interested in reachability properties and asymptotic behaviors, which correspond to terminal strongly connected components (or "attractors") in the state transition graph. A well-known problem is the exponential increase of the size of state transition graphs with the number of network components, in particular when using the biologically realistic asynchronous updating assumption. To address this problem, we have developed several complementary methods enabling the analysis of the behavior of large and complex logical models: (i) the definition of transition priority classes to simplify the dynamics; (ii) a model reduction method preserving essential dynamical properties, (iii) a novel algorithm to compact state transition graphs and directly generate compressed representations, emphasizing relevant transient and asymptotic dynamical properties. The power of an approach combining these different methods is demonstrated by applying them to a recent multilevel logical model for the network controlling CD4+ T helper cell response to antigen presentation and to a dozen cytokines. This model accounts for the differentiation of canonical Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, as well as of inflammatory Th17 and regulatory T cells, along with many hybrid subtypes. All these methods have been implemented into the software GINsim, which enables the definition, the analysis, and the simulation of logical regulatory graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.},

	abstract = {The aging hematopoietic system undergoes numerous changes, including reduced production of red blood cells and lymphocytes as well as a relative increase in the production of myeloid cells. Emerging evidence indicates that many of these changes are due to selection pressures from cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that result in clonal shifts in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, resulting in predominant HSC clones that exhibit the functional characteristics associated with HSC aging. Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle.

Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors. These include opposing effects of Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to pathogens. This study establishes CRISP-seq as a broadly applicable, comprehensive, and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits.},

	abstract = {Aging is a pleiotropic process affecting many aspects of mammalian physiology. Mammals are composed of distinct cell type identities and tissue environments, but the influence of these cell identities and environments on the trajectory of aging in individual cells remains unclear. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on {\textgreater}50,000 individual cells across three tissues in young and old mice to allow for direct comparison of aging phenotypes across cell types. We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating. These results suggest that aging manifests with unique directionality and magnitude across the diverse cell identities in mammals.},

However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {During thymic development, thymocytes expressing a T cell receptor consisting of an alpha and beta chain (TCRαβ), commit to either the cytotoxic- or T helper-lineage fate. This lineage dichotomy is controlled by key transcription factors, including the T helper (Th) lineage master regulator, the Th-inducing BTB/POZ domain-containing Kruppel-like zinc-finger transcription factor, ThPOK, (formally cKrox or Zfp67; encoded by Zbtb7b), which suppresses the cytolytic program in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted CD4(+) thymocytes and the Runt related transcription factor 3 (Runx3), which counteracts ThPOK in MHC class I restricted precursor cells and promotes the lineage commitment of CD8αβ(+) cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). ThPOK continues to repress the CTL gene program in mature CD4(+) T cells, even as they differentiate into effector Th cell subsets. The Th cell fate however is not fixed and two recent studies showed that mature, antigen-stimulated CD4(+) T cells have the flexibility to terminate the expression of ThPOK and functionally reprogram to cytotoxic effector cells. This unexpected plasticity of CD4(+) T cells results in the post-thymic termination of the Th lineage fate and the functional differentiation of distinct MHC class II-restricted CD4(+) CTL. The recognition of CD4 CTL as a defined separate subset of effector cells and the identification of the mechanisms and factors that drive their reprogramming finally create new opportunities to explore the physiological relevance of these effector cells in vivo and to determine their pivotal roles in both, protective immunity as well as in immune-related pathology.},

	abstract = {T cells are key elements of cancer immunotherapy1 but certain fundamental properties, such as the development and migration of T cells within tumours, remain unknown. The enormous T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is required for the recognition of foreign and self-antigens2, could serve as lineage tags to track these T cells in tumours3. Here we obtained transcriptomes of 11,138 single T cells from 12 patients with colorectal cancer, and developed single T cell analysis by RNA sequencing and TCR tracking (STARTRAC) indices to quantitatively analyse the dynamic relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct functions and clonalities. Although both CD8+ effector and ‘exhausted’ T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T cells, most tumour-infiltrating T regulatory (Treg) cells showed clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg cell clones were developmentally linked to several T helper (TH) cell clones. Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like cell clusters in tumours that were associated with distinct IFNγ-regulating transcription factors —the GZMK+ effector memory T cells, which were associated with EOMES and RUNX3, and CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cell clusters, which were associated with BHLHE40. Only CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells were preferentially enriched in patients with microsatellite-instable tumours, and this might explain their favourable responses to immune-checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, IGFLR1 was highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses provide a powerful approach to dissect the T cell properties in colorectal cancer comprehensively, and could provide insights into the dynamic relationships of T cells in other cancers.},

	abstract = {Immune responses involve coordination across cell types and tissues. However, studies in cancer immunotherapy have focused heavily on local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate immune activity more broadly, we performed an organism-wide study in genetically engineered cancer models using mass cytometry. We analyzed immune responses in several tissues after immunotherapy by developing intuitive models for visualizing single-cell data with statistical inference. Immune activation was evident in the tumor and systemically shortly after effective therapy was administered. However, during tumor rejection, only peripheral immune cells sustained their proliferation. This systemic response was coordinated across tissues and required for tumor eradication in several immunotherapy models. An emergent population of peripheral CD4 T cells conferred protection against new tumors and was significantly expanded in patients responding to immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive tumor rejection.},

Computational algorithms and machine learning methods then provide the tools to derive meaningful insights from the resulting data sets. One such approach is graphical network modeling, which provides a computational framework to explicitly model the molecular interactions within and between the cells comprising biological systems. These graphical networks aim to describe a putative chain of cause and effect between interacting molecules. This feature allows for determination of key molecules in a biological process, accelerated generation of mechanistic hypotheses, and simulation of experimental outcomes. We review the computational concepts and applications of graphical network models across molecular scales for both intracellular and intercellular regulatory biology, examples of successful applications, and the future directions needed to overcome current limitations.},

Single-cell measurement of chromatin accessibility (DNA), gene expression (RNA), and proteins has revealed rich cellular diversity across tissues, organisms, and disease states. However, single-cell data poses a unique set of challenges. A dataset may comprise millions of cells with tens of thousands of sparse features. Identifying biologically relevant signals from the background sources of technical noise requires innovation in predictive and representational learning. Furthermore, unlike in machine vision or natural language processing, biological ground truth is limited. Here we leverage recent advances in multi-modal single-cell technologies which, by simultaneously measuring two layers of cellular processing in each cell, provide ground truth analogous to language translation. We deﬁne three key tasks to predict one modality from another and learn integrated representations of cellular state. We also generate a novel dataset of the human bone marrow speciﬁcally designed for benchmarking studies. The dataset and tasks are accessible through an open-source framework that facilitates centralized evaluation of community-submitted methods.},

	abstract = {RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Chronic infection with persistent antigenic stimulation results in the generation of exhausted CD8+ T cells, which are considered defective effector CD8+ T cells, and thus compromises effective immune responses. However, recent studies have illustrated that exhausted CD8+ T cells may be purposely generated and maintained to provide mild immune responses against chronic infection or cancer, which can be safer over a long period of time than strong immune responses. Indeed, a specific population of exhausted CD8+ T cells that behaves similarly to self-renewing stem cells and provides a continuous supply of exhausted CD8+ T cells has been identified, indicating that this population can be considered progenitors of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, several ground-breaking studies in the last few years have shed new light on the transcriptional regulatory network governing the generation and propagation of exhausted CD8+ T cells, which involves T cell receptor (TCR) signaling that leads to NFAT-TCF1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells-T cell factor 1) activity followed by activation of the TOX/NR4A axis. Elucidation of the intracellular signaling pathways will help to define the definitive developmental stages leading to exhausted CD8+ T cells, which can be exploited to advance our never-ending battle against cancer. This review will summarize the recent discoveries that have deepened our understanding of the exhaustion program of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.},

Genetic variations in genes encoding histones, epigenetics-related enzymes or modifiers affect chromatin structure/dynamics and result in alterations in gene expression contributing to cancer development or progression. Gliomas are brain tumors frequently associated with epigenetics-related gene deregulation. We perform whole-genome mapping of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation patterns and transcriptome analysis simultaneously in multiple tumor samples to unravel epigenetic dysfunctions driving gliomagenesis. Based on the results of the integrative analysis of the acquired profiles, we create an atlas of active enhancers and promoters in benign and malignant gliomas. We explore these elements and intersect with Hi-C data to uncover molecular mechanisms instructing gene expression in gliomas.},

	abstract = {Synovial sarcoma (SyS) is an aggressive neoplasm driven by the SS18–SSX fusion, and is characterized by low T cell infiltration. Here, we studied the cancer–immune interplay in SyS using an integrative approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial profiling and genetic and pharmacological perturbations. scRNA-seq of 16,872 cells from 12 human SyS tumors uncovered a malignant subpopulation that marks immune-deprived niches in situ and is predictive of poor clinical outcomes in two independent cohorts. Functional analyses revealed that this malignant cell state is controlled by the SS18–SSX fusion, is repressed by cytokines secreted by macrophages and T cells, and can be synergistically targeted with a combination of HDAC and CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors. This drug combination enhanced malignant-cell immunogenicity in SyS models, leading to induced T cell reactivity and T cell–mediated killing. Our study provides a blueprint for investigating heterogeneity in fusion-driven malignancies and demonstrates an interplay between immune evasion and oncogenic processes that can be co-targeted in SyS and potentially in other malignancies.},

However, it is unknown whether the origins of different macrophage populations affect their roles in malignancy. Given potential artifacts associated with irradiation-based lineage tracing, it remains unclear if bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are present in tumors of the brain, a tissue with no homeostatic involvement of BMDMs. Here, we employed multiple models of murine brain malignancy and genetic lineage tracing to demonstrate that BMDMs are abundant in primary and metastatic brain tumors. Our data indicate that distinct transcriptional networks in brain-resident microglia and recruited BMDMs are associated with tumor-mediated education yet are also influenced by chromatin landscapes established before tumor initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microglia specifically repress Itga4 (CD49D), enabling its utility as a discriminatory marker between microglia and BMDMs in primary and metastatic disease in mouse and human.},

	abstract = {Despite their key regulatory role and therapeutic potency, the molecular signatures of interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment remain poorly characterized. Here, we systematically characterize these interactions using RNA sequencing of physically interacting cells (PIC-seq) and find that CD4+PD-1+CXCL13+ T cells are a major interacting hub with antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment of human non-small cell lung carcinoma. We define this clonally expanded, tumor-specific and conserved T-cell subset as T-helper tumor (Tht) cells. Reconstitution of Tht cells in vitro and in an ovalbumin-specific αβ TCR CD4+ T-cell mouse model, shows that the Tht program is primed in tumor-draining lymph nodes by dendritic cells presenting tumor antigens, and that their function is important for harnessing the antitumor response of anti-PD-1 treatment. Our molecular and functional findings support the modulation of Tht–dendritic cell interaction checkpoints as a major interventional strategy in immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {Anti-PD-1 treatment has shown unprecedented clinical success in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed temporal single-cell RNA and paired T-cell receptor sequencing on 47 tumor biopsies from 36 patients with NSCLC following PD-1-based therapies. We observed increased levels of precursor exhausted T (Texp) cells in responsive tumors after treatment, characterized by low expression of coinhibitory molecules and high expression of GZMK. By contrast, nonresponsive tumors failed to accumulate Texp cells. Our data suggested that Texp cells were unlikely to be derived from the reinvigoration of terminally exhausted cells; instead, they were accumulated by (1) local expansion and (2) replenishment by peripheral T cells with both new and pre-existing clonotypes, a phenomenon we named clonal revival. Our study provides insights into mechanisms underlying PD-1-based therapies, implicating clonal revival and expansion of Texp cells as steps to improve NSCLC treatment.},

Here, we identify conserved intratumoral CD4 and CD8 T cell behaviors in scRNA-seq data from 25 melanoma patients. We discover a large population of CD8 T cells showing continuous progression from an early effector “transitional” into a dysfunctional T cell state. CD8 T cells that express a complete cytotoxic gene set are rare, and TCR sharing data suggest their independence from the transitional and dysfunctional cell states. Notably, we demonstrate that dysfunctional T cells are the major intratumoral proliferating immune cell compartment and that the intensity of the dysfunctional signature is associated with tumor reactivity. Our data demonstrate that CD8 T cells previously defined as exhausted are in fact a highly proliferating, clonal, and dynamically differentiating cell population within the human tumor microenvironment.},

Cancer cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment together determine disease progression, as well as response to or escape from treatment. To map the cell type-specific transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyze 42 tissue biopsy samples from stage III/IV NSCLC patients by single cell RNA sequencing and present the large scale, single cell resolution profiles of advanced NSCLCs. In addition to cell types described in previous single cell studies of early stage lung cancer, we are able to identify rare cell types in tumors such as follicular dendritic cells and T helper 17 cells. Tumors from different patients display large heterogeneity in cellular composition, chromosomal structure, developmental trajectory, intercellular signaling network and phenotype dominance. Our study also reveals a correlation of tumor heterogeneity with tumor associated neutrophils, which might help to shed light on their function in NSCLC.},

The exponential explosion of massive cancer scRNA-seq datasets in the past decade are calling for a burning demand to be integrated and processed for essential investigations in tumor microenvironment of various cancer types. To fill this gap, we developed a database of Cancer Single-cell Expression Map (CancerSCEM, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cancerscem), particularly focusing on a variety of human cancers. To date, CancerSCE version 1.0 consists of 208 cancer samples across 28 studies and 20 human cancer types. A series of uniformly and multiscale analyses for each sample were performed, including accurate cell type annotation, functional gene expressions, cell interaction network, survival analysis and etc. Plus, we visualized CancerSCEM as a user-friendly web interface for users to browse, search, online analyze and download all the metadata as well as analytical results. More importantly and unprecedentedly, the newly-constructed comprehensive online analyzing platform in CancerSCEM integrates seven analyze functions, where investigators can interactively perform cancer scRNA-seq analyses. In all, CancerSCEM paves an informative and practical way to facilitate human cancer studies, and also provides insights into clinical therapy assessments.},

Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on {\textgreater}50,000 individual cells across three tissues in young and old mice to allow for direct comparison of aging phenotypes across cell types. We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating. These results suggest that aging manifests with unique directionality and magnitude across the diverse cell identities in mammals.},

The comprehensive single cell data set permits mapping of the mouse hematopoietic stem cell differentiation hierarchy by computational lineage progression analysis. Further profiling of 180 intracellular regulators enabled construction of a genetic network to assign the earliest differentiation event during hematopoietic lineage specification.

We introduce an automated massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach for analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy.

	abstract = {Tracing the emergence of the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in human embryos, particularly the scarce and transient precursors thereof, is so far challenging, largely due to the technical limitations and the material rarity. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed the first genome-scale gene expression landscape covering the entire course of endothelial-to-HSC transition during human embryogenesis. The transcriptomically defined HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) were captured at Carnegie stage (CS) 12–14 in an unbiased way, showing an unambiguous feature of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) with the up-regulation of RUNX1, MYB and ANGPT1. Importantly, subcategorizing CD34+CD45− ECs into a CD44+ population strikingly enriched HECs by over 10-fold. We further mapped the developmental path from arterial ECs via HSC-primed HECs to hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, and revealed a distinct expression pattern of genes that were transiently over-represented upon the hemogenic fate choice of arterial ECs, including EMCN, PROCR and RUNX1T1. We also uncovered another temporally and molecularly distinct intra-embryonic HEC population, which was detected mainly at earlier CS 10 and lacked the arterial feature. Finally, we revealed the cellular components of the putative aortic niche and potential cellular interactions acting on the HSC-primed HECs. The cellular and molecular programs that underlie the generation of the first HSCs from HECs in human embryos, together with the ability to distinguish the HSC-primed HECs from others, will shed light on the strategies for the production of clinically useful HSCs from pluripotent stem cells.},

Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled the construction of comprehensive transcriptional atlases of adult tissues and of developing embryos from measurements of up to millions of individual cells. Parallel advances in sequencing-based lineage-tracing methods now facilitate the mapping of clonal relationships onto these landscapes and enable detailed comparisons between molecular and mitotic histories. Here we review recent progress and challenges, as well as the opportunities that emerge when these two complementary representations of cellular history are synthesized into integrated models of cell differentiation.},

However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNA-seq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

Here, we present single-cell aggregation of cell-states (SEACells), an algorithm for identifying metacells; overcoming the sparsity of single-cell data, while retaining heterogeneity obscured by traditional cell clustering. SEACells outperforms existing algorithms in identifying accurate, compact, and well-separated metacells in both RNA and ATAC modalities across datasets with discrete cell types and continuous trajectories. We demonstrate the use of SEACells to improve gene-peak associations, compute ATAC gene scores and measure gene accessibility in each metacell. Metacell-level analysis scales to large datasets and are particularly well suited for patient cohorts, including facilitation of data integration. We use our metacells to reveal expression dynamics and gradual reconfiguration of the chromatin landscape during hematopoietic differentiation, and to uniquely identify CD4 T cell differentiation and activation states associated with disease onset and severity in a COVID-19 patient cohort.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease.

	abstract = {Organ- and body-scale cell atlases have the potential to transform our understanding of human biology. To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59\% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},

We generated a comprehensive single-cell atlas of gastric cancer (\&gt;200,000 cells) comprising 48 samples from 31 patients across clinical stages and histologic subtypes. We identified 34 distinct cell-lineage states including novel rare cell populations. Many lineage states exhibited distinct cancer-associated expression profiles, individually contributing to a combined tumor-wide molecular collage. We observed increased plasma cell proportions in diffuse-type tumors associated with epithelial-resident KLF2 and stage-wise accrual of cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations marked by high INHBA and FAP coexpression. Single-cell comparisons between patient-derived organoids (PDO) and primary tumors highlighted inter- and intralineage similarities and differences, demarcating molecular boundaries of PDOs as experimental models. We complemented these findings by spatial transcriptomics, orthogonal validation in independent bulk RNA-sequencing cohorts, and functional demonstration using in vitro and in vivo models. Our results provide a high-resolution molecular resource of intra- and interpatient lineage states across distinct gastric cancer subtypes.We profiled gastric malignancies at single-cell resolution and identified increased plasma cell proportions as a novel feature of diffuse-type tumors. We also uncovered distinct cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes with INHBA–FAP-high cell populations as predictors of poor clinical prognosis. Our findings highlight potential origins of deregulated cell states in the gastric tumor ecosystem.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 587},

Recent progress in single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry, and digital spatial profiling has enabled the detailed characterization of intratumoral immune cells and vastly improved our understanding of less-defined cell subsets in the tumor immune environment. By measuring transcriptomes or proteomics at the single-cell level, it provides an unprecedented view of the cellular architecture consist of phenotypical and functional diversities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

In addition to cell types described in previous single cell studies of early stage lung cancer, we are able to identify rare cell types in tumors such as follicular dendritic cells and T helper 17 cells. Tumors from different patients display large heterogeneity in cellular composition, chromosomal structure, developmental trajectory, intercellular signaling network and phenotype dominance.

Here, we review recent findings on heterogeneity of tumor-specific T cells and exhausted T cells during chronic infections, discussing distinct differentiation state dynamics, fate choices, and functional states. Delineating the regulatory mechanisms defining distinct T cell states and determining the requirements for therapeutic reprogramming of these states will provide needed insights for the design of effective immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and chronic infections.},

Here, we performed temporal single-cell RNA and paired T-cell receptor sequencing on 47 tumor biopsies from 36 patients with NSCLC following PD-1-based therapies. We observed increased levels of precursor exhausted T (Texp) cells in responsive tumors after treatment, characterized by low expression of coinhibitory molecules and high expression of GZMK. By contrast, nonresponsive tumors failed to accumulate Texp cells. Our data suggested that Texp cells were unlikely to be derived from the reinvigoration of terminally exhausted cells; instead, they were accumulated by (1) local expansion and (2) replenishment by peripheral T cells with both new and pre-existing clonotypes, a phenomenon we named clonal revival. Our study provides insights into mechanisms underlying PD-1-based therapies, implicating clonal revival and expansion of Texp cells as steps to improve NSCLC treatment.},

We discover a large population of CD8 T cells showing continuous progression from an early effector “transitional” into a dysfunctional T cell state. CD8 T cells that express a complete cytotoxic gene set are rare, and TCR sharing data suggest their independence from the transitional and dysfunctional cell states. Notably, we demonstrate that dysfunctional T cells are the major intratumoral proliferating immune cell compartment and that the intensity of the dysfunctional signature is associated with tumor reactivity. Our data demonstrate that CD8 T cells previously defined as exhausted are in fact a highly proliferating, clonal, and dynamically differentiating cell population within the human tumor microenvironment.},

Here, we generated a realistic benchmark experiment that included single cells and admixtures of cells or RNA to create ‘pseudo cells’ from up to five distinct cancer cell lines. In total, 14 datasets were generated using both droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols. We compared 3,913 combinations of data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation revealed pipelines suited to different types of data for different tasks. Our data and analysis provide a comprehensive framework for benchmarking most common scRNA-seq analysis steps.},

In contrast to other methods, ProjecTILs allows not only accurate embedding of new scRNA-seq data into a reference without altering its structure, but also characterizing previously unknown cell states that “deviate” from the reference. ProjecTILs accurately predicts the effects of cell perturbations and identifies gene programs that are altered in different conditions and tissues.

	abstract = {Genetic perturbations of cerebral cortical development can lead to neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To identify genomic regions crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility both independently and jointly.

	abstract = {One of the pressing open problems of computational systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high throughput genomic data, in particular microarray gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

GRNs obtained using Machine Learning techniques are often dense, whereas real GRNs are rather sparse. We use a Tikonov regularization inspired optimal L-curve criterion that utilizes the edge weight distribution for a given target gene to determine the optimal set of TFs associated with it. Our proposed framework allows to incorporate a mechanistic active biding network based on cis-regulatory motif analysis. We evaluate our regularization framework in conjunction with two non-linear ML techniques, namely gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random-forests (GENIE), resulting in a regularized feature selection based method specifically called RGBM and RGENIE respectively. RGBM has been used to identify the main transcription factors that are causally involved as master regulators of the gene expression signature activated in the FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma. Here, we illustrate that RGBM identifies the main regulators of the molecular subtypes of brain tumors. Our analysis reveals the identity and corresponding biological activities of the master regulators characterizing the difference between G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low subtypes and between PA-like and LGm6-GBM, thus providing a clue to the yet undetermined nature of the transcriptional events among these subtypes.},

Notably, immunotherapies have raised hope for a successful control of these advanced diseases, but their therapeutic responses are suboptimal and vary considerably among individuals. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are often correlated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance, including immunotherapies. Thus, a deeper understanding of the complex roles of TAMs in immunotherapy regulation could provide new insight into the TME. Furthermore, targeting of TAMs is an emerging field of interest due to the hope that these strategies will synergize with current immunotherapies. In this review, we summarize recent studies investigating the involvement of TAMs in immune checkpoint inhibition, tumor vaccines and adoptive cell transfer therapies, and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting TAMs as an adjuvant therapy in tumor immunotherapies.},

	abstract = {Primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), are remarkably resistant to immunotherapy, even though pre-clinical models suggest effectiveness. To understand this better in patients, here we take advantage of our recent neoadjuvant treatment paradigm to map the infiltrating immune cell landscape of GBM and how this is altered following PD-1 checkpoint blockade using high dimensional proteomics, single cell transcriptomics, and quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade increases T cell infiltration and the proportion of a progenitor exhausted population of T cells found within the tumor. We identify an early activated and clonally expanded CD8+ T cell cluster whose TCR overlaps with a CD8+ PBMC population. Distinct changes are also observed in conventional type 1 dendritic cells that may facilitate T cell recruitment. Macrophages and monocytes still constitute the majority of infiltrating immune cells, even after anti-PD-1 therapy. Interferon-mediated changes in the myeloid population are consistently observed following PD-1 blockade; these also mediate an increase in chemotactic factors that recruit T cells. However, sustained high expression of T-cell-suppressive checkpoints in these myeloid cells continue to prevent the optimal activation of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Therefore, future immunotherapeutic strategies may need to incorporate the targeting of these cells for clinical benefit.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the profiling of the gene expression dynamics of these cell fate decisions, yet a comprehensive map of the interplay between transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements is lacking, as are the underlying gene regulatory networks. Here we generate a multi-omics atlas of mouse early organogenesis by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility from tens of thousands of single cells. We develop a computational method to leverage the multi-modal readouts to predict transcription factor binding events in cis-regulatory elements, which we then use to infer gene regulatory networks that underpin lineage commitment events. Finally, we show that these models can be used to generate in silico predictions of the effect of transcription factor perturbations. We validate this experimentally by showing that Brachyury is essential for the differentiation of neuromesodermal progenitors to somitic mesoderm fate by priming cis-regulatory elements.},

Our understanding of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) remains limited, and it is unknown whether it is sculpted differentially by primary versus metastatic disease. We therefore comprehensively analyzed the brain TME landscape via flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, protein arrays, culture assays, and spatial tissue characterization. This revealed disease-specific enrichment of immune cells with pronounced differences in proportional abundance of tissue-resident microglia, infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells. These integrated analyses also uncovered multifaceted immune cell activation within brain malignancies entailing converging transcriptional trajectories while maintaining disease- and cell-type-specific programs. Given the interest in developing TME-targeted therapies for brain malignancies, this comprehensive resource of the immune landscape offers insights into possible strategies to overcome tumor-supporting TME properties and instead harness the TME to fight cancer.},

	abstract = {Cancer relapse is caused by a subset of malignant cells that are resistant to treatment. To characterize resistant cells and their vulnerabilities, we studied the retinoic acid (RA)-resistant PLZF-RARA acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) using single-cell multi-omics. We uncovered transcriptional and chromatin heterogeneity in leukemia cells and identified a subset of cells resistant to RA that depend on a fine-tuned transcriptional network targeting the epigenetic regulator Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Epigenomic and functional analyses validated EZH2 selective dependency of PLZF-RARA leukemia and its driver role in RA resistance. Targeting pan-EZH2 activities (canonical/non-canonical) was necessary to eliminate leukemia relapse initiating cells, which underlies a dependency of resistant cells on an EZH2 non-canonical activity and the necessity to degrade EZH2 to overcome resistance.
Our study provides critical insights into the mechanisms of RA resistance that allow us to eliminate treatment-resistant leukemia cells by targeting EZH2, thus highlighting a potential targeted therapy approach.
HIGHLIGHTS- sc-RNAseq identifies PLZF-RARA leukemia heterogeneity and retinoic acid resistant cells- sc-ATACseq refines leukemic cell identity and resolves retinoic acid resistant networks- EZH2 is a selective dependency of PLZF-RARA leukemia and drives retinoic acid resistance- Targeting pan-EZH2 activities (canonical/non-canonical) is necessary to overcome leukemia onset},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging is a multifactorial event that leads to changes in HSC properties and function. These changes are intrinsically coordinated and affect the early hematopoiesis, involving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The objective of this work is to better understand the mechanisms and factors controlling these changes. We have therefore developed an original strategy to construct a Boolean network of genes explaining the priming and homeostasis of HSCs (graphical abstract). Based on our previous scRNA-seq data, we performed an exhaustive analysis of the transcriptional network and identified active transcription modules or regulons along the differentiation trajectory of selected HSPC states. This global view of transcriptional regulation led us to focus on 15 components, 13 selected TFs (Tal1, Fli1, Gata2, Gata1, Zfpm1, Egr1, Junb, Ikzf1, Myc, Cebpa, Bclaf1, Klf1, Spi1) and 2 complexes regulating the ability of HSC to cycle (CDK4/6 - Cyclin D and CIP/KIP). We then defined the connections controlling the differentiation dynamics of HSC states and constructed an influence graph between the TFs involved in the dynamics by mixing observations from our scRNA-seq data and knowledge from the literature. Then, using answer set programming (ASP) and in silico perturbation analysis, we obtained a Boolean model which is the solution of a Boolean satisfiability problem. Finally, perturbation of the model based on age-related changes revealed important regulations, such as the overactivation of Egr1 and Junb or the loss of Cebpa activation by Gata2, which were found to be relevant for the myeloid bias of aged HSC. Our work shows the efficiency of the combination of manual and systematic methods to elaborate a Boolean model. The developed strategy led to the proposal of new regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation bias of aged HSCs, explaining the decreased transcriptional priming of HSCs to all mature cell types except megakaryocytes.
Graphical abstract From single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and current knowledge in early hematopoiesis (literature and biological database investigation), 3 inputs were obtained to define the network synthesis as a Boolean Satisfiability Problem depending on observations of states in the differentiation process: Influence graph between selected components.Discretized component activity levels in the considered states (blue: 0/inactive, white: */unknown or free, red: 1/active).Dynamic relations (stable states, (non) reachability) between the considered states. Then, these inputs were encoded as constraints in Answer Set Programing (ASP) thanks to the Bonesis tool. After the solving, a Boolean model of early hematopoiesis is obtained. This model is altered according to the characteristics of aging observed in our scRNA-seq data, in order to identify the main molecular actors and mechanisms of aging.{\textless}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Graphical abstract:" src="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/05/08/2022.02.08.479548/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="262"/{\textgreater}Download figureOpen in new tabGraphical abstract: Overview of the scRNA-seq assisted gene Boolean network synthesis strategy.},

We argue that most of the causes that underlie HSC aging result from cell-intrinsic pathways, and reflect on which aspects of the aging process may be reversible. Because many hematological pathologies are strongly age-associated, strategies to intervene in aspects of the stem cell aging process may have significant clinical relevance.},

PLZF displays an epigenetic specificity by recruiting chromatin-modifying factors but little is known about its role in remodeling chromatin of cells committed toward a given specific hematopoietic lineage. In murine myeloid progenitors, we decipher a new role for PLZF in restraining active genes and enhancers by targeting acetylated lysine 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27ac). Functional analyses reveal that active enhancers bound by PLZF are involved in biological processes related to metabolism and associated with hematopoietic aging. Comparing the epigenome of young and old myeloid progenitors, we reveal that H3K27ac variation at active enhancers is a hallmark of hematopoietic aging. Taken together, these data suggest that PLZF, associated with active enhancers, appears to restrain their activity as an epigenetic gatekeeper of hematopoietic aging.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have proposed that tumor-specific tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8 TIL) can be classified into two main groups: “exhausted” TILs, characterized by high expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 and lack of transcription factor 1 (Tcf1); and “memory-like” TILs, with self-renewal capacity and co-expressing Tcf1 and PD-1. However, a comprehensive definition of the heterogeneity existing within CD8 TILs has yet to be clearly established. To investigate this heterogeneity at the transcriptomic level, we performed paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of CD8 T cells infiltrating B16 murine melanoma tumors, including cells of known tumor specificity. Unsupervised clustering and gene-signature analysis revealed four distinct CD8 TIL states – exhausted, memory-like, naïve and effector memory-like (EM-like) – and predicted novel markers, including Ly6C for the EM-like cells, that were validated by flow cytometry. Tumor-specific PMEL T cells were predominantly found within the exhausted and memory-like states but also within the EM-like state. Further, T cell receptor sequencing revealed a large clonal expansion of exhausted, memory-like and EM-like cells with partial clonal relatedness between them. Finally, meta-analyses of public bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data suggested that anti-PD-1 treatment induces the expansion of EM-like cells. Our reference map of the transcriptomic landscape of murine CD8 TILs will help interpreting future bulk and single-cell transcriptomic studies and may guide the analysis of CD8IL subpopulations in response to therapeutic interventions.},

By interpreting the hematopoietic literature and translating experimental evidence into Boolean rules, we implement binary dynamics on the resulting 11-factor regulatory network. Our network contains interesting functional modules and a concatenation of mutual antagonistic pairs. The state space of our model is a hierarchical, acyclic graph, typifying the principles of myeloid differentiation. We observe excellent agreement between the steady states of our model and microarray expression profiles of two different studies.

	doi = {10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083997},
	abstract = {In recent years, there is an increasing interest in the research community in finding community structure in complex networks. The networks are usually represented as graphs, and the task is usually cast as a graph clustering problem. Traditional clustering algorithms and graph partitioning algorithms have been applied to this problem. New graph clustering algorithms have also been proposed. Random walk based clustering, in which the similarities between pairs of nodes in a graph are usually estimated using random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, is one of the most popular graph clustering methods. Most of these clustering algorithms only find disjoint partitions in networks; however, communities in many real-world networks often overlap to some degree. In this paper, we propose an efficient clustering method based on random walks for discovering communities in graphs. The proposed method makes use of network topology and edge weights, and is able to discover overlapping communities. We analyze the effect of parameters in the proposed method on clustering results. We evaluate the proposed method on real world social networks that are well documented in the literature, using both topological-based and knowledge-based evaluation methods. We compare the proposed method to other clustering methods including recently published Repeated Random Walks, and find that the proposed method achieves better precision and accuracy values in terms of six statistical measurements including both data-driven and knowledge-driven evaluation metrics.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review 
        In the last few decades, revolutionary advances in next-generation sequencing have led to single-cell lineage tracing technologies that now enable researchers to identify and quantify hematopoietic cell behavior with unprecedented detail. Combined readouts of cell lineage and cell state from the same cell mitigate the need to prospectively isolate populations of interest, and allow a system-level understanding of dynamic developmental processes. We will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these technologies, the intriguing discoveries that stemmed from lineage tracing hematopoiesis at the single-cell level and the directions toward which the field is moving.
        Recent findings 
        Single-cell lineage tracing studies unveiled extensive functional heterogeneity within discrete immunophenotypic populations. Recently, several groups merged lineage tracing with single-cell RNA sequencing to visualize clonal relationships directly on transcriptional landscapes without the requirement for prospective isolation of cell types by FACS. To study the cell dynamics of hematopoiesis, without perturbation in their native niche, researchers have developed mouse models with endogenous single-cell lineage tracing systems, which can simultaneously trace thousands of hematopoietic progenitor cells in a single mouse, without transplantation. The emerging picture is that multiple hematopoietic hierarchies coexist within a single individual, each with distinct regulatory features. These hierarchies are imprinted during development much earlier than previously predicted, persisting well into adulthood and even after injury and transplantation.
        Summary 
        Clone-tracking experiments allow stem-cell researchers to characterize lineage hierarchies during blood development and regeneration. Combined with single-cell genomics analyses, these studies are allowing system-level description of hematopoiesis in mice and humans. Early exploratory studies have unveiled features with important implications for human biology and disease.

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling and experiments show how a pattern recognition receptor helps to stimulate T cell activation. In addition to receiving antigen-driven signals through their T cell receptors (TCRs), CD4+ T cells also require activation of the costimulatory receptor CD28 to ensure full activation. Rodríguez-Jorge et al. combined mathematical modeling of signaling by the TCR and by the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR5) to predict how the two pathways could combine to induce T cell activation. Experiments then showed how the TCR and TLR5 pathways converged on the activation of critical transcriptional regulators needed for T cell activation, suggesting that TLR5 plays a role similar to that of CD28 in T cell activation. CD4+ T cells recognize antigens through their T cell receptors (TCRs); however, additional signals involving costimulatory receptors, for example, CD28, are required for proper T cell activation. Alternative costimulatory receptors have been proposed, including members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, such as TLR5 and TLR2. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying a potential costimulatory role for TLR5, we generated detailed molecular maps and logical models for the TCR and TLR5 signaling pathways and a merged model for cross-interactions between the two pathways. Furthermore, we validated the resulting model by analyzing how T cells responded to the activation of these pathways alone or in combination, in terms of the activation of the transcriptional regulators CREB, AP-1 (c-Jun), and NF-κB (p65). Our merged model accurately predicted the experimental results, showing that the activation of TLR5 can play a similar role to that of CD28 activation with respect to AP-1, CREB, and NF-κB activation, thereby providing insights regarding the cross-regulation of these pathways in CD4+ T cells.},

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.},

Although a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) can generate sufficient primitive progeny to repopulate many recipients, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that maintain their potency or regulate their self renewal. Here we have examined the gene expression changes that occur over a time course when HSCs are induced to proliferate and return to quiescence in vivo. These data were compared to data representing differences between naturally proliferating fetal HSCs and their quiescent adult counterparts. Bioinformatic strategies were used to group time-ordered gene expression profiles generated from microarrays into signatures of quiescent and dividing stem cells. A novel method for calculating statistically significant enrichments in Gene Ontology groupings for our gene lists revealed elemental subgroups within the signatures that underlie HSC behavior, and allowed us to build a molecular model of the HSC activation cycle. Initially, quiescent HSCs evince a state of readiness. The proliferative signal induces a preparative state, which is followed by active proliferation divisible into early and late phases. Re-induction of quiescence involves changes in migratory molecule expression, prior to reestablishment of homeostasis. We also identified two genes that increase in both gene and protein expression during activation, and potentially represent new markers for proliferating stem cells. These data will be of use in attempts to recapitulate the HSC self renewal process for therapeutic expansion of stem cells, and our model may correlate with acquisition of self renewal characteristics by cancer stem cells., This comprehensive study of gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells reveals some key cellular changes that occur when the stem cells transition from quiescence to proliferation and back again},
